// expression and a substitution string.
message RegexMatchAndSubstitute {
  // The regular expression used to find portions of a string (hereafter called
  // the "subject string") that should be replaced. When a new string is
  // produced during the substitution operation, the new string is initially
  // the same as the subject string, but then all matches in the subject string
  // are replaced by the substitution string. If replacing all matches isn't
  // desired, regular expression anchors can be used to ensure a single match,
  // so as to replace just one occurrence of a pattern. Capture groups can be
  // used in the pattern to extract portions of the subject string, and then
  // referenced in the substitution string.

  // The string that should be substituted into matching portions of the
  // subject string during a substitution operation to produce a new string.
  // Capture groups in the pattern can be referenced in the substitution
  // string. Note, however, that the syntax for referring to capture groups is
  // defined by the chosen regular expression engine. Google's `RE2
  // <https://github.com/google/re2>`_ regular expression engine uses a
  // backslash followed by the capture group number to denote a numbered
  // capture group. E.g., ``\1`` refers to capture group 1, and ``\2`` refers
  // to capture group 2.
