// [#protodoc-title: Envoy's default Header Validator config]

// This extension validates that HTTP request and response headers are well formed according to respective RFCs.
//
// The validator performs comprehensive HTTP header validation including:
//
// #. HTTP/1 header map validity according to `RFC 7230 section 3.2 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2>`_.
// #. Syntax of HTTP/1 request target URI and response status.
// #. HTTP/2 header map validity according to `RFC 7540 section 8.1.2 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2>`_.
// #. Syntax of HTTP/2 pseudo headers.
// #. HTTP/3 header map validity according to `RFC 9114 section 4.3  <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html>`_.
// #. Syntax of HTTP/3 pseudo headers.
// #. Syntax of Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding.
// #. Validation of HTTP/1 requests with both ``Content-Length`` and ``Transfer-Encoding`` headers.
// #. Normalization of the URI path according to `Normalization and Comparison <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6>`_
//    without `case normalization <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2.1>`_.
//
// This validator ensures that HTTP traffic processed by Envoy conforms to established
// standards and helps prevent issues caused by malformed headers or invalid HTTP syntax.
