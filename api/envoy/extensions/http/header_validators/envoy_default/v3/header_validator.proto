// 2. Syntax of HTTP/1 request target URI and response status
// 3. H/2 header map validity according to `RFC 7540 section 8.1.2 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2>`_
// 4. Syntax of HTTP/2 pseudo headers
// 5. HTTP/3 header map validity (TBD standard link when approved)
// 6. Syntax of HTTP/3 pseudo headers
// 7. Syntax of Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding
// 8. Validation of HTTP/1 requests with both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers
// 9. Normalization of the URI path according to `Normalization and Comparison <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6>`_
//    without `case normalization <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2.1>`_
