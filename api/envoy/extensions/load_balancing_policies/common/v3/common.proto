  // This is implemented based on the method described in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01350. For the specified
  // ``hash_balance_factor``, requests to any upstream host are capped at ``hash_balance_factor/100`` times the average number of requests
  // across the cluster. When a request arrives for an upstream host that is currently serving at its max capacity, linear probing
  // is used to identify an eligible host. Further, the linear probe is implemented using a random jump in hosts ring/table to identify
  // the eligible host (this technique is as described in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08762 - the random jump avoids the
  // cascading overflow effect when choosing the next host in the ring/table).
  //
  // If weights are specified on the hosts, they are respected.
  //

  // being probed, so use a higher value if you require better performance.
