// [#protodoc-title: Dynamic Modules common configuration]

// Configuration of a dynamic module. A dynamic module is a shared object file that can be loaded via dlopen
// by a various Envoy extension points. Currently, only HTTP filter (envoy.filters.http.dynamic_modules) is supported.
//
// How the module is loaded is determined by the extension point that uses it. For example, the HTTP filter
// loads the module with dlopen on the first creation of the filter chain for the same shared object file.
//
// Whether or not the shared object is the same is determined by the file path as well as the file's inode depending
// on the platform. Notably, if the file path and the content of the file are the same, the shared object will be reused.
//
// A module must be compatible with the ABI specified in :repo:`abi.h <source/extensions/dynamic_modules/abi.h>`.
// Currently, compatibility is only guaranteed by an exact version match between the Envoy
// codebase and the dynamic module SDKs. In the future, after the ABI is stabilized, we will revisit
// this restriction and hopefully provide a wider compatibility guarantee. Until then, Envoy
// checks the hash of the ABI header files to ensure that the dynamic modules are built against the
// same version of the ABI.
//
// Currently, the implementation is work in progress and not usable.
// [#next-free-field: 8]
