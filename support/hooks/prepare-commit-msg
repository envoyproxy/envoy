# of any commit message that doesn't have one. This append happens after the git
# default message is generated, but before the user is dropped into the commit
# message editor.
#
# To enable this hook, run `bootstrap` or do this from the root of the repo:
#
# $ ln -s ../../support/hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg

# the user that you did so.
