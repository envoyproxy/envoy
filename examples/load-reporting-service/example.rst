Load reporting service (``LRS``)
================================

.. sidebar:: Requirements

   .. include:: _include/docker-env-setup-link.rst

This simple example demonstrates Envoy's :ref:`Load reporting service (LRS) <arch_overview_load_reporting_service>`
capability and how to use it.

Lets say Cluster A (downstream) talks to Cluster B (Upstream) and Cluster C (Upstream). When enabling Load Report for
Cluster A, LRS server should be sending LoadStatsResponse to Cluster A with LoadStatsResponse.Clusters to be B and C.
LRS server will then receive LoadStatsRequests (with total requests, successful requests etc) from Cluster A to Cluster B and
from Cluster A to Cluster C.

In this example, all incoming requests are routed via Envoy to a simple goLang web server aka http_server.
We scale up two containers and randomly send requests to each. Envoy is configured to initiate the connection with LRS Server.
LRS Server enables the stats by sending LoadStatsResponse. Sending requests to http_server will be counted towards successful
requests and will be visible in LRS Server logs.

Step 1: Build the sandbox
*************************

Change to the ``examples/load-reporting-service`` directory.

Terminal 1 ::

    $ pwd
    envoy/examples/load-reporting-service
    $ docker compose pull
    $ docker compose up --scale http_service=2


Terminal 2 ::

    $ pwd
    envoy/examples/load_reporting_service
    $ docker compose ps

                  Name                               Command               State                Ports
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    load-reporting-service_http_service_1   /docker-entrypoint.sh /usr ... Up           10000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:81->80/tcp
    load-reporting-service_http_service_2   python3 /code/service.py   ... Up (healthy)
    load-reporting-service_lrs_server_1     go run main.go                 Up

Step 2: Start sending stream of HTTP requests
*********************************************

Terminal 2 ::

  $ pwd
  envoy/examples/load_reporting_service
  $ bash send_requests.sh

The script above (:download:`send_requests.sh <_include/load-reporting-service/send_requests.sh>`) sends requests
randomly to each Envoy, which in turn forwards the requests to the backend service.

Step 3: See Envoy Stats
