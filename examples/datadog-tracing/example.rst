Datadog tracing
===============

.. sidebar:: Requirements

   .. include:: _include/docker-env-setup-link.rst

   :ref:`curl <start_sandboxes_setup_curl>`
        Used to make ``HTTP`` requests.

The Datadog tracing sandbox demonstrates Envoy's :ref:`request tracing <arch_overview_tracing>`
capabilities using `Datadog <https://datadoghq.com/>`_ as the tracing provider.

This example includes a Datadog Agent which will forward to Datadog's backend traces sent from Envoy and the upstream `http` service.

The ``envoy`` service is exposed on port ``10000`` and the request flow is as follow:

    User -> ``envoy`` -> ``http``

The Envoy proxy is configured (:download:`envoy.yaml <_include/datadog-tracing/envoy.yaml>`) to generate and propagate tracing context to upstream services and also to
report tracing data to the Datadog Agent through an Envoy cluster nammed ``datadog_agent``.

Each span records the latency of upstream API calls as well as information needed to correlate the span with other related spans (e.g., the trace ID).

Step 1: Build the sandbox
*************************

Change directory to ``examples/datadog-tracing`` in the Envoy repository.

To build this sandbox example, and start the example services run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pwd
    envoy/examples/datadog-tracing
    $ export DD_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
    $ docker compose pull
    $ docker compose up --build -d
    $ docker compose ps

                Name                          Command             State            Ports
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    datadog-tracing-dd-agent-1   "/bin/entrypoint.sh"             running      8125/udp, 0.0.0.0:8126->8126/tcp
    datadog-tracing-envoy-1      "/docker-entrypoint.…"           running      10000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:10000->1337/tcp
    datadog-tracing-http-1       "node --require dd-t…"           running      0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp

Step 2: Make a request to ``http``
**********************************

Now send a request to the ``http`` service, by calling http://localhost:10000.

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl localhost:10000
    {
      "service": "http",
      "headers": {
        "host": "localhost:10000",
        "user-agent": "curl/7.81.0",
        "accept": "*/*",
        "x-forwarded-for": "172.16.14.142",
        "x-forwarded-proto": "http",
        "x-envoy-internal": "true",
        "x-request-id": "cfa52b85-8660-9532-b347-bd484da76166",
        "x-envoy-expected-rq-timeout-ms": "15000",
        "x-foobar-banana": "",
        "x-datadog-trace-id": "13944358220549386131",
        "x-datadog-parent-id": "13944358220549386131",
        "x-datadog-sampling-priority": "1",
        "x-datadog-tags": "_dd.p.tid=663fe98600000000,_dd.p.dm=-0",
        "traceparent": "00-663fe98600000000c1844febd4a4ef93-c1844febd4a4ef93-01",
        "tracestate": "dd=s:1;t.dm:-0"
      }
    }

Step 3: View the traces in Datadog UI
*************************************

Log in your Datadog account and navigate to APM tracing page.

.. image:: /start/sandboxes/_include/datadog-tracing/datadog-ui-landing.png

Click on any of the trace with the service name ``envoy``. From here you can explore the paths taken by the requests, as well as the latency incurred at each hop,
and other contextual information.

.. image:: /start/sandboxes/_include/datadog-tracing/datadog-ui-trace.png

Note the Datadog tracer identifies the Envoy proxies by the name provided in the ``tracing.provider.typed_config.service_name`` configuration.

You can also explore the map graph to view relationships between nodes and the path of traces.
