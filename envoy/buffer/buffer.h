   * represent as a 32-bit (4 bytes) integer. One option to deal with that situation is to read 4
   * bytes from the buffer and ignore 1. There are a few problems with that solution, though.
   *   * The first problem is buffer underflow: there may not be more than Size bytes available
   * (say, last field in the payload), so that's an edge case to take into consideration.
   *   * The second problem is draining the buffer after reading. With the above solution we cannot
   *     read and discard in one go. We'd need to peek 4 bytes, ignore 1 and then drain 3. That not
   *     only looks hacky since the sizes don't match, but also produces less terse code and
   * requires the caller to propagate that logic to all call sites. Things complicate even further
   * when endianness is taken into consideration: should the most or least-significant bytes be
   * padded? Dealing with this situation requires a high level of care and attention to detail.
   * Properly calculating which bytes to discard and how to displace the data is not only error
   * prone, but also shifts to the caller a burden that could be solved in a much more generic,
   * transparent and well tested manner.
   *   * The last problem in the list is sign extension, which should be properly handled when
   * reading signed types with negative values. To make matters easier, the optional Size parameter
   * can be specified in those situations where there's a need to read less bytes than a C++'s
   * integer size in bytes. For the most common case when one needs to read exactly as many bytes as
   * the size of C++'s integer, this parameter can simply be omitted and it will be automatically
