/**
 * A thread aware load balancer is a load balancer that is global to all workers on behalf of a
 * cluster. These load balancers are harder to write so not every load balancer has to be one.
 * If a load balancer is a thread aware load balancer, the following semantics are used:
 * 1) A single instance is created on the main thread.
 * 2) The shared factory is passed to all workers.
 * 3) Every time there is a host set update on the main thread, all workers will create a new
 *    worker local load balancer via the factory.
 *
 * The above semantics mean that any global state in the factory must be protected by appropriate
 * locks. Additionally, the factory *must not* refer back to the owning thread aware load
 * balancer. If a cluster is removed via CDS, the thread aware load balancer can be destroyed
 * before cluster destruction reaches each worker. See the ring hash load balancer for one
 * example of how this pattern is used in practice. The common expected pattern is that the
 * factory will be consuming shared immutable state from the main thread
 *
 * TODO(mattklein123): The reason that locking is used in the above threading model vs. pure TLS
 * has to do with the lack of a TLS function that does the following:
 * 1) Create a per-worker data structure on the main thread. E.g., allocate 4 objects for 4
 *    workers.
 * 2) Then fan those objects out to each worker.
 * With the existence of a function like that, the callback locking from the worker to the main
 * thread could be removed. We can look at this in a follow up. The reality though is that the
 * locking is currently only used to protect some small bits of data on host set update and will
 * never be contended.
