    # It is recommended to configure either HTTP/2 or TCP keepalives in order to detect
    # connection issues, and allow Envoy to reconnect. TCP keepalive is less expensive, but
    # may be inadequate if there is a TCP proxy between Envoy and the management server.
    # HTTP/2 keepalive is slightly more expensive, but may detect issues through more types
    # of intermediate proxies.
