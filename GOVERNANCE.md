# Process for becoming a committer

## Your organization is not yet a committer

* Express interest to the senior committers that your organization is interested in becoming a
  committer. Becoming a committer generally means that you are going to be spending substantial
  time (>25%) on Envoy for the foreseeable future. You should have domain expertise and be extremely
  proficient in C++. Ultimately your goal is to become a senior committer that will represent your
  organization.
* We will expect you to start contributing increasingly complicated PRs, under the guidance
  of the existing senior committers.
* We may ask you to do some PRs from our backlog.
* As you gain experience with the code base and our standards, we will ask you to do code reviews
  for incoming PRs (i.e., all committers are expected to shoulder a proportional share of
  community reviews).
* After a period of approximately 2-3 months of working together and making sure we see eye to eye,
  the existing senior committers will confer and decide whether to grant commit status or not. We
  make no guarantees on the length of time this will take, but 2-3 months is the approximate
  goal.

## Your organization is currently a committer

* First decide whether your organization really needs more people with commit access. Valid reasons
  are "blast radius", a large organization that is working on multiple unrelated projects, etc.
* Contact a senior committer for your organization and express interest.
* Start doing PRs and code reviews under the guidance of your senior committer.
* After a period of 1-2 months the existing senior committers will discuss granting "standard"
  commit access.
* "Standard" commit access can be upgraded to "senior" commit access after another 1-2 months of
  work and another conference of the existing senior committers.
