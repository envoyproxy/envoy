[Cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/)

Envoy is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are a
company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged,
dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's
involved and how Envoy plays a role, read the CNCF
[announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/09/13/cncf-hosts-envoy/).

## Contributing

Contributing to Envoy is fun and modern C++ is a lot less scary than you might think if you don't
have prior experience. To get started:

* [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner)
* [Build/test quick start using docker](ci#building-and-running-tests-as-a-developer)
* [Developer guide](DEVELOPER.md)
* Consider installing the Envoy [development support toolchain](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/support/README.md), which helps automate parts of the development process, particularly those involving code review.
* Please make sure that you let us know if you are working on an issue so we don't duplicate work!

## Community Meeting

The Envoy team meets twice per month on Tuesday at 9am PT. The public

## Security

### Security Audit

There has been several third party engagements focused on Envoy security:
* In 2018 Cure53 performed a security audit, [full report](docs/security/audit_cure53_2018.pdf).
* In 2021 Ada Logics performed an audit on our fuzzing infrastructure with recommendations for improvements, [full report](docs/security/audit_fuzzer_adalogics_2021.pdf).

### Reporting security vulnerabilities

If you've found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in Envoy please let us know at
[envoy-security](mailto:envoy-security@googlegroups.com). We'll send a confirmation
email to acknowledge your report, and we'll send an additional email when we've identified the issue
positively or negatively.
