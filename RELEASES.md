# Release Process

## Active development

Active development is happening on the `main` branch, and a new version is released from it.

## Stable releases

Stable releases of Envoy include:

* Major releases in which a new version a created directly from the `main` branch.
* Minor releases for versions covered by the extended maintenance window (any version released in the last 12 months).
  * Security fixes backported from the `main` branch (including those deemed not worthy
    of creating a CVE).
  * Stability fixes backported from the `main` branch (anything that can result in a crash,
    including crashes triggered by a trusted control plane).
  * Bugfixes, deemed worthwhile by the maintainers of stable releases.

Major releases happen quartely and follow the schedule below. Security fixes typically happen
quarterly as well, but this depends on the number and severity of security bugs. Other releases
are ad-hoc and best-effort.

### Security releases

Critical security fixes are owned by the Envoy security team, which provides fixes for the
`main` branch. Once those fixes are ready, the maintainers
of stable releases backport them to the remaining supported stable releases.

### Backports

All other security and reliability fixes can be nominated for backporting to stable releases
by Envoy maintainers, Envoy security team, the change author, or members of the Envoy community
by adding the `backport/review` or `backport/approved` label (this can be done using [repokitteh]'s
`/backport` command). Changes nominated by the change author and/or members of the Envoy community
are evaluated for backporting on a case-by-case basis, and require approval from either the release
manager of stable release, Envoy maintainers, or Envoy security team. Once approved, those fixes
are backported from the `main` branch to all supported stable branches by the maintainers of
stable releases. New stable versions from non-critical security fixes are released on a regular
schedule, initially aiming for the bi-weekly releases.

### Release management

Major releases are handled by the maintainer on-call and do not involve any backports.
The details are outlined in the "Cutting a major release" section below.
Security releases are handled by a Release Manager and a Fix Lead. The Release Manager is
responsible for approving and merging backports, with responsibilties outlined
in [BACKPORTS.md](BACKPORTS.md).
The Fix Lead is a member of the security
team and is responsible for coordinating the overall release. This includes identifying
issues to be fixed in the release, communications with the Envoy community, and the
actual mechanics of the release itself.

## Major release schedule

In order to accommodate downstream projects, new Envoy releases are produced on a fixed release
schedule (the 15th day of each quarter), with an acceptable delay of up to 2 weeks, with a hard
deadline of 3 weeks.

### Cutting a major release

* Take a look at open issues tagged with the current release, by
  [searching](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues) for
  "is:open is:issue milestone:[current milestone]" and either hold off until
  they are fixed or bump them to the next milestone.
* Begin marshalling the ongoing PR flow in this repo. Ask maintainers to hold off merging any
  particularly risky PRs until after the release is tagged. This is because we aim for main to be
  at release candidate quality at all times.
* Do a final check of the [release notes](changelogs/current.yaml):
  * Make any needed corrections (grammar, punctuation, formatting, etc.).
  * Check to see if any security/stable version release notes are duplicated in
    the major version release notes. These should not be duplicated.
  * Switch the repo to "release" mode by running `bazel run @envoy_repo//:release`. This tool
    will create a commit with the necessary changes for a release.
  * Update the [RELEASES](RELEASES.md) doc with the relevant dates. Now, or after you cut the
    release, please also make sure there's a stable maintainer signed up for next quarter,
    and the deadline for the next release is documented in the release schedule.
  * Get a review and merge.
* Create a pull request with that commit and **wait for tests to pass**.
* Once the tests have passed, and the PR has landed, CI will automatically create the tagged release and corresponding release branch.
* Switch the repo back to "dev" mode by running `bazel run @envoy_repo//:dev`. This tool will create a commit with the
  necessary changes to continue development.
* Create a pull request with that commit.
* Run the deprecate_versions.py script (`bazel run //tools/deprecate_version:deprecate_version`)
* If you haven't done this before, request posting permission from admins for all the groups in the next bullet.
* Craft a witty/uplifting email and send it to all the email aliases:
envoy-announce@googlegroups.com
envoy-users@googlegroups.com
envoy-dev@googlegroups.com
envoy-maintainers@googlegroups.com -
include in this email a link to the latest [release page](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases) (ending in `tag/[version]`)
* Announce in [#envoy-dev](https://envoyproxy.slack.com/archives/C78HA81DH) and [#envoy-users](https://envoyproxy.slack.com/archives/C78M4KW76) slack channels.

## Security release schedule

Security releases are published on a 3-monthly cycle, around the mid point between major releases.

| Quarter |  Expected  |   Actual   | Difference |
|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| 2024 Q2 | 2024/06/04 | 2024/06/04 |   0 days   |
| 2024 Q3 | 2024/09/03 |

NOTE: Zero-day vulnerabilities, and upstream vulnerabilities disclosed to us under embargo, may necessitate an emergency release with little or no warning.
