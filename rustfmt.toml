# Rust Autoformatter Config
# =========================
#
# Note that most of rustfmt's configurable settings are nightly-only,
# so we tend to run that. Typically we don't rely on unstable features,
# but in this case there's honestly not a lot to configure that _isn't_
# behind the `unstable_features` gate, unfortunately.

edition           = "2021"

# Try to use inline annotations before using this -- disabling autoformatting
# for a file makes it harder for everyone to share their work in that file and
# invites bikeshedding about how code in there should look.

# Features are broken up into Stable and Unstable features, listed in order of
# appearance in the Configuring Rustfmt document:
# https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/blob/master/Configurations.md
