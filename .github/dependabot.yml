updates:

# We currently have CI to make sure that all python `requirements.txt` files
# are listed here, and only existing `requirements.txt` files are listed here.
#
# Until https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/26163 is resolved `Dockerfiles`,
# and `go.mod` files need to be kept in sync manually.
#
# Please ensure any new ones are added here, and any that are removed are removed here also.
