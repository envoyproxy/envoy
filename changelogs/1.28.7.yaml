behavior_changes:
- area: http
  change: |
    The default configuration of Envoy will continue to trust internal addresses while in the future it will not trust them by default.
    If you have tooling such as probes on your private network which need to be treated as trusted (e.g. changing arbitrary ``x-envoy``
    headers) please explictily include those addresses or CIDR ranges into :ref:`internal_address_config
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.internal_address_config>`
    See the config examples from the above ``internal_address_config`` link. This default no trust internal address can be turned on by
    setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config`` to ``true``.

minor_behavior_changes:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Sanitize SNI for potential log injection. The invalid character will be replaced by ``_`` with an ``invalid:`` marker. If runtime
    flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_sni_in_access_log`` is set to ``false``, the sanitize behavior is disabled.

bug_fixes:
- area: http_async_client
  change: |
    Fixed the local reply and destroy order crashes when using the http async client for websocket handshake.
