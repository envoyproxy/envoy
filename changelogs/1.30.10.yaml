minor_behavior_changes:
- area: rds
  change: |
    When a new RDS provider config is pushed via xDS and the only difference is change to
    :ref:`initial_fetch_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.initial_fetch_timeout>`,
    the already existing provider will be reused. Envoy will not ask RDS server for routes
    config because existing provider already has up to date routes config.
    This behavioral change can be enabled by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.normalize_rds_provider_config`` to true.

bug_fixes:
- area: lrs
  change: |
    Fixes errors stat being incremented and warning log spamming for LoadStatsReporting graceful stream close.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Fixes a bug where local replies were incorrectly sent to the ext_proc server for external processing.
    This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy_reloadable_features_skip_ext_proc_on_local_reply``
    to ``false``.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixes an Envoy crash issue when a local reply is sent.
    This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy_reloadable_features_router_filter_resetall_on_local_reply`` to ``false``.
