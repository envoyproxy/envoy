    update Curl -> 8.0.1 to resolve CVE-2023-27535, CVE-2023-27536, CVE-2023-27538.
- area: http
  change: |
    amend the fix for ``x-envoy-original-path`` so it removes the header only at edge.
    Previously this would also remove the header at any Envoy instance upstream of an external request, including an Envoy
    instance that added the header.
