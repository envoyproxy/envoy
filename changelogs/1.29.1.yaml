bug_fixes:
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added support for configuring resource detectors on the OpenTelemetry tracer.
- area: proxy protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
- area: url matching
  change: |
    Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
    ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in an mTLS client cert IP SAN. These SANs will be ignored. This applies only when using formatter
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_IP_SAN%``.

removed_config_or_runtime:
- area: postgres proxy
  change: |
    Fix a race condition that may result from upstream servers refusing to switch to TLS/SSL.
    This fix first appeared in ``v1.29.0`` release.
