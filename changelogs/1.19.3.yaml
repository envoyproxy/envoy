behavior_changes:
- area: dns_filter
  change: |
    :ref:`dns_filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3alpha.DnsFilterConfig>` protobuf fields have been
    renumbered to restore compatibility with Envoy 1.18, breaking compatibility with Envoy 1.19.0 and 1.19.1. The new field
    numbering allows control planes supporting Envoy 1.18 to gracefully upgrade to :ref:`dns_resolution_config
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3alpha.DnsFilterConfig.ClientContextConfig.dns_resolution_config>`,
    provided they skip over Envoy 1.19.0 and 1.19.1. Control planes upgrading from Envoy 1.19.0 and 1.19.1 will need to
    vendor the corresponding protobuf definitions to ensure that the renumbered fields have the types expected by those
    releases.
