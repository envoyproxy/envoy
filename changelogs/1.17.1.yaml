bug_fixes:
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    reject requests with a proper error if JWT has the wrong issuer when allow_missing is used. Before this change, the
    requests are accepted.
- area: overload
  change: |
    fix a bug that can cause use-after-free when one scaled timer disables another one with the same duration.
