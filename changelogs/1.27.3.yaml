minor_behavior_changes:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    When emitting grpc logs, only downstream filter state was used. Now, both downstream and upstream filter states will be tried
    to find the keys configured in filter_state_objects_to_log.

bug_fixes:
- area: buffer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
    behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed recursion when HTTP connection is disconnected due to a high number of premature resets.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Datadog spans tagged as errors would not have the appropriate error property set.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where child spans produced by the Datadog tracer would have an incorrect operation name.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that caused the Datadog tracing extension to drop traces that
    should be kept on account of an extracted sampling decision.
- area: proxy protocol
  change: |
    fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
    ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in an mTLS client cert IP SAN. These SANs will be ignored. This applies only when using formatter
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_IP_SAN%``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
- area: url matching
  change: |
    Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
