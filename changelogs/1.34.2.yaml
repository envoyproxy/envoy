bug_fixes:
- area: conn_pool
  change: |
    Fixed an issue that could lead to too many connections when using
    :ref:`AutoHttpConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.AutoHttpConfig>` if the
    established connection is ``http/2`` and Envoy predicted it would have lower concurrent capacity.
- area: conn_pool
  change: |
    Fixed an issue that could lead to insufficient connections for current pending requests. If a connection starts draining while it
    has negative unused capacity (which happens if an HTTP/2 ``SETTINGS`` frame reduces allowed concurrency to below the current number
    of requests), that connection's unused capacity will be included in total pool capacity even though it is unusable because it is
    draining. This can result in not enough connections being established for current pending requests. This is most problematic for
    long-lived requests (such as streaming gRPC requests or long-poll requests) because a connection could be in the draining state
    for a long time.
- area: config_validation
  change: |
    Fixed an bug where the config validation server will crash when the configuration contains
    ``%CEL%`` or ``%METADATA%`` substitution formatter.
- area: release
  change: |
    Container (Ubuntu) updates to resolve glibc vulnerabilities.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Validate HTTP/3 pseudo headers. Can be disabled by setting ``envoy.restart_features.validate_http3_pseudo_headers`` to false.
