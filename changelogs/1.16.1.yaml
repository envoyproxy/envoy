bug_fixes:
- area: examples
  change: |
    examples use v3 configs.
- area: listener
  change: |
    fix crash when disabling or re-enabling listeners due to overload while processing LDS updates.
- area: proxy_proto
  change: |
    fixed a bug where the wrong downstream address got sent to upstream connections.
- area: proxy_proto
  change: |
    fixed a bug where network filters would not have the correct ``downstreamRemoteAddress()`` when accessed from the
    ``StreamInfo``. This could result in incorrect enforcement of RBAC rules in the RBAC network filter (but not in the RBAC
    HTTP filter), or incorrect access log addresses from tcp_proxy.
- area: tls
  change: |
    fix read resumption after triggering buffer high-watermark and all remaining request/response bytes are stored in the
    SSL connection's internal buffers.
- area: udp
  change: |
    fixed issue in which receiving truncated UDP datagrams would cause Envoy to crash.
