minor_behavior_changes:
- area: http
  change: |
    reject requests with \#fragment in the URI path. The fragment is not allowed to be part of request URI according to
    RFC3986 (3.5), RFC7230 (5.1) and RFC 7540 (8.1.2.3). Rejection of requests can be changed to stripping the \#fragment
    instead by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_reject_path_with_fragment`` to false. This
    behavior can further be changed to the deprecated behavior of keeping the fragment by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_strip_fragment_from_path_unsafe_if_disabled``. This runtime guard must only be set to
    false when existing non-compliant traffic relies on \#fragment in URI. When this option is enabled, Envoy request
    authorization extensions may be bypassed. This override and its associated behavior will be decommissioned after the
    standard deprecation period.

bug_fixes:
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    fix the ext_authz filter to correctly merge multiple same headers using the ',' as separator in the check request to the
    external authorization service.
