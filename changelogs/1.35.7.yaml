behavior_changes:
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    The dynamic module ABI has been updated to support streaming body manipulation. This change also
    fixed potential incorrect behavior when access or modify the request or response body. See
    https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/40918 for more details.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_early_connect_data`` to reject ``CONNECT`` requests
    that receive data before Envoy sent a ``200`` response to the client. While this is not a strictly compliant behavior
    it is very common as a latency reducing measure. As such the option is disabled by default.

bug_fixes:
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a connection leak in the TCP proxy when the ``receive_before_connect`` feature is enabled and the
    downstream connection closes before the upstream connection is established.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fixed an issue where SANs of type ``OTHERNAME`` in a TLS cert were truncated if there was
    an embedded null octet, leading to incorrect SAN validation.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a remote ``jwt_auth`` token fetch crash with two or more auth headers when ``allow_missing_or_failed`` is set.

new_features:
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Added support for loading dynamic modules globally by setting :ref:`load_globally
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig.load_globally>` to true.
