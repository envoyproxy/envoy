    reverting a behavioral change where upstream connect timeouts were temporarily treated differently from other connection
    failures. The change back to the original behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.treat_upstream_connect_timeout_as_connect_failure`` to false.

    fix detection of the upstream connection close event.
