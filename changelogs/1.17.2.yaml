bug_fixes:
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a crash upon receiving empty HTTP/2 metadata frames. Received empty metadata frames are now counted in the HTTP/2
    codec stat :ref:`metadata_empty_frames <config_http_conn_man_stats_per_codec>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a remotely exploitable integer overflow via a very large grpc-timeout value causes undefined behavior.
- area: http
  change: |
    reverting a behavioral change where upstream connect timeouts were temporarily treated differently from other connection
    failures. The change back to the original behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.treat_upstream_connect_timeout_as_connect_failure`` to false.
- area: tls
  change: |
    fix a crash when peer sends a TLS Alert with an unknown code.

new_features:
- area: dispatcher
  change: |
    supports a stack of ``Envoy::ScopeTrackedObject`` instead of a single tracked object. This will allow Envoy to dump more
    debug information on crash.
