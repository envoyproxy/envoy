changes:
- area: listener
  change: |
    fix crash when disabling or re-enabling listeners due to overload while processing LDS updates.
- area: proxy_proto
  change: |
    fixed a bug where network filters would not have the correct downstreamRemoteAddress() when accessed from the
    StreamInfo. This could result in incorrect enforcement of RBAC rules in the RBAC network filter (but not in the RBAC
    HTTP filter), or incorrect access log addresses from tcp_proxy.
- area: tls
  change: |
    fix read resumption after triggering buffer high-watermark and all remaining request/response bytes are stored in the
    SSL connection's internal buffers.
- area: udp
  change: |
    fixed issue in which receiving truncated UDP datagrams would cause Envoy to crash.
- area: vrp
  change: |
    allow supervisord to open its log file.
