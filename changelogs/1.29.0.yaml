behavior_changes:
- area: http
  change: |
    Remove the hop by hop TE header from downstream request headers. This change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_te`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Flip runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_downgrade_to_canonical_name`` to ``true``. Name downgrading in the
    per filter config searching will be disabled by default. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting
    the flag to ``false`` explicitly.
    See doc :ref:`Http filter route specific config <arch_overview_http_filters_per_filter_config>` or
    issue https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/29461 for more specific detail and examples.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Undeprecated runtime key ``overload.global_downstream_max_connections`` until :ref:`downstream connections monitor
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>` extension becomes stable.
- area: stats dns_filter
  change: |
    Fixed tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3.DnsFilterConfig>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    ``dns_filter_myprefix_local_a_record_answers{}`` to ``dns_filter_local_a_record_answers{envoy.dns_filter_prefix="myprefix"}``.
- area: stats connection_limit
  change: |
    Fixed tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.connection_limit.v3.ConnectionLimit>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from ``envoy_connection_limit_myprefix_limited_connections{}`` to
    ``envoy_connection_limit_limited_connections{envoy_connection_limit_prefix="myprefix"}``.
- area: stats rbac
  change: |
    Fixed tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.rbac.v3.RBAC>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from ``envoy_myprefixrbac_allowed{}`` to
    ``envoy_rbac_allowed{envoy_rbac_prefix="myprefix"}``.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Changes the default value of ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to ``true``. This changes the codec used for HTTP/2
    requests and responses. This behavior can be reverted by setting the feature to ``false``.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Discard the ``Host`` header if the ``:authority`` header was received to bring Envoy into compliance with
    https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-8.3.1 This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_discard_host_header`` to ``false``.
- area: grpc reverse bridge
  change: |
    Handle empty response bodies in ``grpc_http1_reverse_bridge``. This may cause problems for clients expecting the filter to crash
    for empty responses.  This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.grpc_http1_reverse_bridge_handle_empty_response`` to ``false``.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added issuer in certificate_properties to the gRPC access log service(AlS).

minor_behavior_changes:
- area: golang
  change: |
    Remove ``Protocol`` method from ``RequestHeaderMap``.
    To get the protocol, please use ``GetProperty("request.protocol")`` instead.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Added support to use HTTP async client to fetch the credentials from EC2 instance metadata and ECS task metadata providers
    instead of libcurl which is deprecated. By default this behavior is disabled. To enable set
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_http_client_to_fetch_aws_credentials`` to ``true``.
- area: local_rate_limit
  change: |
    Added new configuration field :ref:`rate_limited_as_resource_exhausted
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.local_ratelimit.v3.LocalRateLimit.rate_limited_as_resource_exhausted>`
    to allow for setting if rate limit gRPC response should be ``RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`` instead of the default ``UNAVAILABLE``.
- area: config parsing, http cache filter
  change: |
    Replaces Protobuf hashing by human-readable string with a dedicated deterministic hashing algorithm.
    The performance of the hash operation is improved by ``2-10x`` depending on the structure of the message,
    which is expected to reduce config update time or startup time by 10-25%. The new algorithm is also
    used for ``http_cache_filter`` hashing, which will effectively cause a one-time cache flush on update
    for users with a persistent cache. To enable this behavior set ``envoy.restart_features.use_fast_protobuf_hash`` to ``true``.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Flip the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.defer_processing_backedup_streams`` to be on by default.
    This feature improves flow control within the proxy by deferring work on the receiving end if the other
    end is backed up.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Switch no admin ``warning`` -> ``info``.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    Update the stats prefix of generic proxy from ``<stats_prefix>`` to ``generic_proxy.<stats_prefix>``.
- area: header_mutation
  change: |
    If per route configuration is configured at multiple levels (route, virtual host, and route table), all specified
    levels' mutations are applied. Default order is from least to most specific level (i.e. most specific level wins).

bug_fixes:
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Fixed a bug with upstream auto-config with HTTP/3 where certain network configurations would result in zombie
    streams left in the grid. Guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.avoid_zombie_streams``.
- area: buffer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
    behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27702) that caused ADS initialization
    to fail on the first attempt and set a back-off retry interval of up to 1 second, if ADS is
    using an Envoy Cluster for the backend. The issue was fixed to ensure that ADS initialization
    happens after the Envoy Cluster it depends upon has been properly initialized. ADS that does
    not depend on an Envoy Cluster (i.e. GoogleGrpc) is not affected by this change.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that caused the Datadog tracing extension to drop traces that
    should be kept on account of an extracted sampling decision.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in QUIC and HCM interaction which could cause ``use-after-free`` during asynchronous certificates retrieval.
    The fix is guarded by runtime ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_fix_filter_manager_uaf``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in QUIC upstream port migration which could cause use-after-free upon STATELESS_RESET packets.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Fixed a bug causing crash if incoming redis key does not match against a ``prefix_route`` and ``catch_all_route`` is not defined.
- area: access log
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the omit_empty_values field was not honored for access logs specifying formats via text_format_source.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Fixed ``content_length`` related issues when body mutation by external processor is enabled. The ``ext_proc`` filter removes
    the content length header in 1)``STREAMED BodySendMode`` 2) ``BUFFERED_PARTIAL BodySendMode`` and
    3) ``BUFFERED BodySendMode + SKIP HeaderSendMode``. This will enable chunked-encoding whenever feasible in HTTP1.1. Besides,
    ``ext_proc`` filter keep content length header in ``BUFFERED BodySendMode + SEND HeaderSendMode``. It is now external
    processor's responsibility to set the content length correctly matched to the mutated body. if those two doesn't match,
    the mutation will be rejected and local reply with error status will be returned.
- area: dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the preresolved hostnames specified in the Dynamic Forward Proxy cluster
    config would not use the normalized hostname as the DNS cache key, which is the same key
    used for retrieval. This caused cache misses on initial use, even though the host DNS entry
    was pre-resolved. The fix is guarded by runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.normalize_host_for_preresolve_dfp_dns``,
    which defaults to ``true``.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where histogram bucket counts were wrong. Additionally, the number of buckets is fixed and is now
    one element larger than the explicit bounds elements, as required by the specification.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where child spans produced by the Datadog tracer would have an incorrect operation name.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Datadog spans tagged as errors would not have the appropriate error property set.
- area: DNS
  change: |
    Fixed a race condition that when multiple requests with the same authority header are sent to Envoy, sometimes some requests
    may receive ``503`` response with ``no_healthy_upstream`` from Envoy. The fix is guarded by runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.dns_cache_set_first_resolve_complete``, which defaults to ``true``.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that the subset load balancer will always be used even if the subset load balancer config does not
    contain any subset selector.
- area: docker
  change: |
    Updated base image to ``ubuntu:22.04`` to fix Redis memory issue (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/31248).
- area: aws
  change: |
    Default credentials file location was relying on incorrect ``~`` expansion. This fix now resolves to the correct path
    by using ``HOME`` environment variable, if the credentials file location is not explicitly specified.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed a bug to ensure the proper functioning of the ``with_request_body`` feature within the per-route ExtAuthZ filter.
- area: oauth
  change: |
    Add :ref:`default_expires_in <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.default_expires_in>` configuration
    setting. The OAuth spec does not dictate that an authorization server must respond with an expiry. Envoy currently
    fails any OAuth flow if the expiry is not set. This setting allows you to provide a default in this case to ensure
    the OAuth flow can succeed.

- area: http
  change: |
    Removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.expand_agnostic_stream_lifetime`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_original_path`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: composite filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`ExtensionConfiguration discovery service<envoy_v3_api_file_envoy/service/extension/v3/config_discovery.proto>` support for

- area: filter state
  change: |
    Added config name of filter sending a local reply in filter state with key
    ``envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager.local_reply_owner``.

- area: composite filter
  change: |
    Added composite filter's matched action name to filter state with key
    ``envoy.extensions.filters.http.composite.matched_actions``.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Added support for AWS common utility to fetch metadata credentials from AWS STS by using ``WebIdentityToken``. To enable
    you need to set ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_http_client_to_fetch_aws_credentials`` to ``true`` so that web identity
    credentials provider can use http async client to fetch credentials. Web identity credentials provider cannot use current
    default libcurl credentials fetcher which is under deprecation and will soon be removed. Web identity credentials provider
    is not compatible with :ref:`Grpc Credentials AWS IAM <envoy_v3_api_file_envoy/config/grpc_credential/v3/aws_iam.proto>`
    plugin which can only support deprecated libcurl credentials fetcher, see https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/30626.
- area: filters
  change: |
    Added :ref:`the Basic Auth filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.basic_auth.v3.BasicAuth>`, which can be used to
    authenticate user credentials in the HTTP Authentication heaer defined in `RFC7617 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617>`_.
- area: upstream
  change: |

    for each endpoint in a cluster.
- area: jwt
  change: |
    The JWT filter can now serialize non-primitive custom claims when maping claims to headers.
    These claims will be serialized as JSON and encoded as Base64.
- area: jwt
  change: |
    The JWT authentication filter supports changing the routes when either the headers or the
    dynamic metadata are modified.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support to TCP Proxy for recording the latency in ``UpstreamTiming`` from when the first
    initial connection to the upstream cluster was attempted to when either the
    connection was successfully established or the filiter failed to initialize
    any connection to the upstream.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Ratelimit supports setting the HTTP status that is returned to the client when the ratelimit server
    returns an error or cannot be reached with :ref:`status_on_error

    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.charge_cluster_response_stats>`
    for not incrementing cluster statistics on ext_authz response. Default ``true``, no behavior change.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Forward :ref:`filter_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Metadata.filter_metadata>` selected by
    :ref:`route_metadata_context_namespaces
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.route_metadata_context_namespaces>`
    and :ref:`typed_filter_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Metadata.typed_filter_metadata>` selected by

    This metadata propagation is independent from the dynamic metadata from connection and request.
- area: ext_authz_filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`with_request_body
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.CheckSettings.with_request_body>` to optionally override
    the default behavior of sending the request body to the authorization server from the per-route filter.

    Add :ref:`access log options
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.udp_proxy.v3.UdpProxyConfig.access_log_options>`
    to allow recording an access log entry periodically for the UDP session, and allow recording an access
    log entry on the connection tunnel created successfully to upstream when UDP tunneling is configured.
- area: internal_redirects
  change: |
    Added support to copy headers from the redirect response to the
    triggered request. See
    :ref:`response_headers_to_copy<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.InternalRedirectPolicy.response_headers_to_copy>`.
- area: stateful_session
  change: |
    Added :ref:`strict mode <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.stateful_session.v3.StatefulSession.strict>`
    to cookie and header based stateful session. If a destination encoded in :ref:`cookie
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.stateful_session.cookie.v3.CookieBasedSessionState>`
    or in :ref:`specified header
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.http.stateful_session.header.v3.HeaderBasedSessionState.name>` respectively
    is not available, Envoy will return ``503`` instead of selecting another destination from the cluster.
- area: stream info
  change: |
    Added time spent reading request headers to ``DownstreamTiming``.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for the watch command (aborts multi transactions if watched keys change).
- area: grpc_http_bridge
  change: |
    Added :ref:`ignore_query_parameters
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.grpc_http1_bridge.v3.Config.ignore_query_parameters>` option for
