    added the ability to :ref:`unescape slash sequences
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action>`
    in the path. Requests with unescaped slashes can be proxied, rejected or redirected to the new unescaped path. By
    default this feature is disabled. The default behavior can be overridden through
    :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action<config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action>`
    runtime variable. This action can be selectively enabled for a portion of requests by setting the
    :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action_sampling<config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action_enabled>`
    runtime variable.
