    fixed CVE-2020-25017. Previously header matching did not match on all headers for non-inline headers. This patch
    changes the default behavior to always logically match on all headers. Multiple individual
    headers will be logically concatenated with ',' similar to what is done with inline headers. This
    makes the behavior effectively consistent. This behavior can be temporary reverted by setting
    the runtime value ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_match_on_all_headers`` to ``false``.

    Targeted fixes have been additionally performed on the following extensions which make them
    consider all duplicate headers by default as a comma concatenated list:

      1. Any extension using CEL matching on headers.
      2. The header to metadata filter.
      3. The JWT filter.
      4. The Lua filter.

    Like primary header matching used in routing, RBAC, etc. this behavior can be disabled by setting
    the runtime value ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_match_on_all_headers`` to false.

    fixed CVE-2020-25017. The ``setCopy()`` header map API previously only set the first header in the case of duplicate
    non-inline headers. ``setCopy()`` now behaves similarly to the other ``set*()`` APIs and replaces all found
    headers with a single value. This may have had security implications in the extauth filter which
    uses this API. This behavior can be disabled by setting the runtime value
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_set_copy_replace_all_headers`` to false.
