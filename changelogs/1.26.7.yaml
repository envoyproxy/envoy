bug_fixes:
- area: buffer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
    behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed recursion when HTTP connection is disconnected due to a high number of premature resets.
- area: proxy protocol
  change: |
    fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
    ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
- area: url matching
  change: |
    Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
