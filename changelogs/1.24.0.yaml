behavior_changes:
- area: build
  change: |
    official released binary is now built on Ubuntu 20.04, requires glibc >= 2.30.
- area: stats http local_rate_limit
  change: |
    Fixed metric tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.local_ratelimit.v3.LocalRateLimit.stat_prefix>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    envoy_http_local_rate_limit_myprefix_rate_limited{} to envoy_http_local_rate_limit_rate_limited{envoy_local_http_ratelimit_prefix="myprefix"}.
- area: stats network local_rate_limit
  change: |
    Fixed metric tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.local_ratelimit.v3.LocalRateLimit.stat_prefix>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    envoy_local_rate_limit_myprefix_rate_limited{} to envoy_local_rate_limit_rate_limited{envoy_local_ratelimit_prefix="myprefix"}.
- area: http
  change: |
    Envoy no longer adds ``content-length: 0`` header when proxying UPGRADE requests without ``content-length`` and ``transfer-encoding`` headers.
    This behavior change can be reverted by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_skip_adding_content_length_to_upgrade`` runtime flag to false.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Change TLS and QUIC transport sockets to support asynchronous cert validation extension. This behavior change can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.tls_async_cert_validation`` to false.
- area: gcp_authn
  change: |
    Add GCP Authentication filter which can be used to fetch authentication tokens from Google Compute Engine(GCE) metadata server.
- area: http
  change: |
    For HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 codecs, all clients now continue sending data upstream after receiving an end of the server
    stream. This supports the server half-close semantics for TCP tunneling with CONNECT as well as bi-directional
    streaming calls. This behavior change can be reverted by setting the
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_response_half_close`` runtime flag to false.
- area: original_dst
  change: |
    ORIGINAL_DST cluster will not attempt to remove and drain the stale hosts during cleanup if they are still used by
    the connection pools. For HTTP pools, please set :ref:`idle_timeout <faq_configuration_connection_timeouts>` to
    limit the duration of the upstream connections (the default value is 1h, and the recommended value is 5min). This
    behavior change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.original_dst_rely_on_idle_timeout``.
- area: config
  change: |
    Fixed resource tracking when using the Incremental (Delta-xDS) protocol. The protocol state will be updated after
    the resources are successfully ingested and an ACK is sent. This behavior change can be reverted by setting the
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.delta_xds_subscription_state_tracking_fix`` runtime flag to false.

minor_behavior_changes:
- area: logging
  change: |
    changed the ``UPSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS``, ``UPSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT``, and ``UPSTREAM_REMOTE_PORT`` fields to log based on the actual upstream connection rather than the upstream host. This fixes a bug where the address components were not consistently correct for Happy Eyeballs connections and proxied connections, but also means in cases where the host was selected but a connection was not established, the fields will be absent. This change can be temporarily reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.correct_remote_address`` to false.
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    changed behavior of the fixed heap monitor to count pages allocated to TCMalloc as free memory if it's not used by Envoy. This change can be reverted temporarily by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.do_not_count_mapped_pages_as_free`` to true.
- area: prometheus_stats
  change: |
    removed blank line for being compatible with OpenMetrics.
- area: quic
  change: |
    changed the timing of QUIC connection writing data in response to incoming packets in non-Windowns platforms. This change can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_defer_send_in_response_to_packet`` to false.
- area: original_dst
  change: |
    transparent listener can use original_dst filter without nf_conntrack enabled.
- area: cache_filter
  change: |
    added a completion callback to insertHeaders and insertTrailers in cache interface. Any external cache implementation extensions will need to also add this callback, and call it on completion.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    changed behavior of UDP proxy to connect UDP sockets unless ``use_original_src_ip`` is set. This change can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.udp_proxy_connect`` to false.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    added :ref:`virtual host level configuration <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.local_ratelimit.v3.LocalRateLimit.vh_rate_limits>` support for the local ratelimit filter.
- area: health_check
  change: |
    support custom health check address via :ref:`health_check_config <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.endpoint.v3.endpoint.healthcheckconfig>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    changed shadow requests to more closely behave like the requests they are shadowing. This includes matching the upstream logging for the original request, dynamic stats, suppressing Envoy headers, respecting expected request timeout, suppressing grpc request failure code stats and strict header checks. This behaviorial change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.closer_shadow_behavior`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    changed the filter callback interfaces to make sure that downstream-only functionality is explicit.
- area: http
  change: |
    the upstream remote address is now available to downstream filters via the ``upstreamRemoteAddress`` function.
- area: stats
  change: |
    Default tag extraction rules were changed for ``worker_id`` extraction. Previously, ``worker_`` was removed from the original name during the extraction. This
    led to the same base stat name for both the per-worker and overall stat. For instance, in prometheus stats, the following stats were produced: ::

      envoy_listener_downstream_cx_total{} 2.
      envoy_listener_downstream_cx_total{envoy_worker_id="0"} 1.
      envoy_listener_downstream_cx_total{envoy_worker_id="1"} 1.

    This resulted in ``sum(envoy_listener_downstream_cx_total)`` producing 4, even though there are only 2 connections.
    The new behavior results in stats such as this: ::

      envoy_listener_downstream_cx_total{} 2.
      envoy_listener_worker_downstream_cx_total{envoy_worker_id="0"} 1.
      envoy_listener_worker_downstream_cx_total{envoy_worker_id="1"} 1.
- area: dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    No longer waiting on DNS responses in the dynamic forward proxy filter if upstream proxying is turned on. This behaviorial change can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.skip_dns_lookup_for_proxied_requests`` to false.

bug_fixes:
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a bug with internal redirects not being performed for drained connections.
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    fixed a bug where a negative "exp", "iat", or "nbf" integer in JWT token readed as a large positive value.
- area: grpc_transcoder
  change: |
    fixed a bug where a request with a wrong binding type is not rejected if the request body is empty.
- area: listener
  change: |
    fixed a bug that doesn't handle of an update for a listener with IPv4-mapped address correctly, and that will lead to a memory leak.
- area: transport_socket
  change: |
    fixed a bug that prevented the tcp stats to be retrieved when running on kernels different than the kernel where Envoy was built.
- area: logger
  change: |
    added the %j and %_ format support for fine-grain loggers to make it consistant with default loggers.

  change: |
    fixed the routing decision when thrift filters change the value of the cluster header.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed edge-case interaction between weighted clusters, cluster headers and (request|response)_headers_to_(add|remove).
- area: upstream
  change: |
    fixed a bug where custom transport socket hashes might not be respected by wrapper passthrough sockets. This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.fix_hash_key`` to false.
- area: tls
  change: |
    fixed a bug where, when runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.tls_async_cert_validation`` is set to false, the wrong TLS alerts would sometimes be sent in response to certificate validation failures.
