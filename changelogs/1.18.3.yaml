bug_fixes:

    strings.

removed_config_or_runtime:
- area: tls
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.tls_use_io_handle_bio`` runtime guard and legacy code path.

new_features:
- area: http
  change: |
    added the ability to :ref:`unescape slash sequences
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action>`
    in the path. Requests with unescaped slashes can be proxied, rejected or redirected to the new unescaped path. By
    default this feature is disabled. The default behavior can be overridden through
    :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action
    <config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action>` runtime variable. This action can be selectively
    enabled for a portion of requests by setting the :ref:`http_connection_manager.path_with_escaped_slashes_action_sampling
    <config_http_conn_man_runtime_path_with_escaped_slashes_action_enabled>` runtime variable.
