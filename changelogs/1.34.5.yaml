bug_fixes:
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the premature resets of streams may result in the recursive draining and potential
    stack overflow. Setting proper ``max_concurrent_streams`` value for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 could eliminate
    the risk of the stack overflow before this fix.
- area: listeners
  change: |
    Fixed issue where :ref:`TLS inspector listener filter <config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>` timed out
    when used with other listener filters. The bug was triggered when a previous listener filter processed more data
    than the TLS inspector had requested, causing the TLS inspector to incorrectly calculate its buffer growth strategy.
    The fix ensures that buffer growth is now based on actual bytes available rather than the previously requested amount.
