behavior_changes:
- area: http
  change: |
    Added runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_early_connect_data`` to reject ``CONNECT`` requests
    that receive data before Envoy sent a ``200`` response to the client. While this is not a strictly compliant behavior
    it is very common as a latency reducing measure. As such the option is disabled by default.

bug_fixes:
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fixed an issue where SANs of type ``OTHERNAME`` in a TLS cert were truncated if there was
    an embedded null octet, leading to incorrect SAN validation.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a remote ``jwt_auth`` token fetch crash with two or more auth headers when ``allow_missing_or_failed`` is set.
