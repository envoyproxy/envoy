- area: router
  change: |
    Fix a timing issue when upstream requests are empty when decoding data and send local reply when that happends. This is
    controlled by ``envoy_reloadable_features_send_local_reply_when_no_buffer_and_upstream_request``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Applied 2 QUICHE patches for crash bugs in ``QuicSpdyStream`` ``OnDataAvailable()`` and ``OnInitialHeaderComplete()``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed crash bug when QUIC downstream stream was read closed and then timed out.
- area: decompression
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Envoy will go into an endless loop when using the brotli decompressor. If the input stream has
    redundant data, the decompressor will loop forever.
- area: websocket
  change: |
    Only 101 is considered a successful response for websocket handshake for HTTP/1.1, and Envoy as a proxy will proxy the response
    header from upstream to downstream and then close the request if other status is received. This behavior can be
    reverted by ``envoy_reloadable_features_check_switch_protocol_websocket_handshake``.
