- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed upstream client to not close connection when idle timeout fires before the connection is established.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.codec_client_enable_idle_timer_only_when_connected`` to ``false``.
