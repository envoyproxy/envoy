- area: router
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.shadow_policy_inherit_trace_sampling`` and legacy code paths.
- area: dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.avoid_dfp_cluster_removal_on_cds_update`` and legacy code paths.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth2_use_refresh_token`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added support for request payloads in HTTP health checks. The ``send`` field in ``HttpHealthCheck`` can now be
    used to specify a request body to be sent during health checking. This feature supports both hex-encoded text
    and binary payloads, similar to TCP health checks. The payload can only be used with HTTP methods that support
    request bodies (POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS). Methods that must not have request bodies (GET, HEAD, DELETE, TRACE)
    are validated and will throw an error if combined with payloads. The implementation is optimized to process the
    payload once during configuration and reuse it for all health check requests. See :ref:`HttpHealthCheck
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck>` for configuration details.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``filterState()`` on ``streamInfo()`` which provides access to filter state objects stored during request processing.
    This allows Lua scripts to retrieve string, boolean, and numeric values stored by various filters for use in routing decisions,
    header modifications, and other processing logic. See :ref:`Filter State API <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_filter_state_wrapper>`
    for more details.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Add the :ref:`rate_limits
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.rate_limits>`
    field to generate rate limit descriptors. If this field is set, the
    :ref:`VirtualHost.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` or
    :ref:`RouteAction.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.rate_limits>` fields will be ignored. However,
    :ref:`RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits>`
    will take precedence over this field.
- area: cluster
  change: |
    Added ``CompositeCluster`` extension that provides flexible sub-cluster selection strategies. This cluster type
    supports configurable selection strategies (currently ``SEQUENTIAL``), multiple overflow handling options (``FAIL``,
    ``USE_LAST_CLUSTER``, ``ROUND_ROBIN``), and extensible cluster configuration for future enhancements. See
    :ref:`composite cluster docs <arch_overview_composite_cluster>` for more details.
