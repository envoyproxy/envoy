behavior_changes:
- area: http
  change: |
    The route refresh will now results in a tracing refresh. The trace sampling decision and decoration
    of new route will be applied to the active span.
    This change can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.trace_refresh_after_route_refresh`` to ``false``.
    Note, if :ref:`pack_trace_reason
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.request_id.uuid.v3.UuidRequestIdConfig.pack_trace_reason>` is set
    to ``true`` (it is ``true`` by default), then a request have been marked as traced may cannot be
    unmarked as traced after the tracing refresh.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Reverted https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/39740 to re-enable fail_open+FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED configuration combination.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: tap
  change: |
    Previously, streamed trace buffered data was only flushed when it reached the configured size.
    If the threshold was never met, the data remained buffered until the connection was closed.
    With this change, buffered data will be flushed proactively. Specifically, if the buffer does not
    reach the configured size but has been held for more than 15 seconds, it will be sent immediately.
- area: websocket
  change: |
      Allow 4xx and 5xx to go through the filter chain for websocket handshake response check, and the behaviour can be disabled
      by a runtime ``envoy.reloadable_features.websocket_allow_4xx_5xx_through_filter_chain``.
- area: testing
  change: |
    In test code for external extensions, matchers ``Http::HeaderValueOf``, ``HasHeader`` and ``HeaderHasValueRef``
    must be replaced with ``ContainsHeader``.
    Any uses of matcher ``HeaderHasValue(...)`` should be replaced with ``::testing::Pointee(ContainsHeader(...))``.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    Generic proxy codec add the same buffer limit as connection buffer limit, if the buffer limit is
    exceeded, the connection is disconnected. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.generic_proxy_codec_buffer_limit`` to ``false``.
- area: http3
  change: |
    turn off HTTP/3 happy eyeball in upstream via runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http3_happy_eyeballs``.
    It is found to favor TCP over QUIC when UDP does not work on v6 network but works on v4.
- area: mobile
  change: |
    Explicitly drain connections upon network change events regardless of whether the DNS cache is refreshed or not. This behavior
    can be reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.decouple_explicit_drain_pools_and_dns_refresh``
    to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    Adds accounting for decompressed HTTP header bytes sent and received. Existing stats only count wire-encoded header bytes.
    This can be accessed through the ``%UPSTREAM_DECOMPRESSED_HEADER_BYTES_RECEIVED%``,
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_DECOMPRESSED_HEADER_BYTES_RECEIVED%``, ``%UPSTREAM_DECOMPRESSED_HEADER_BYTES_SENT%``, and the
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_DECOMPRESSED_HEADER_BYTES_SENT%`` access_log command operators.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    If :ref:`failure_mode_allow <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.failure_mode_allow>` is true,
    save the grpc failure status code returned from the ext_proc server in the filter state.
    Previously all fail-open cases would return call_status Grpc::Status::Aborted.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a crash in the UDP proxy that occurred during ENVOY_SIGTERM when active tunneling sessions were present.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in the maxmind provider where the found_entry field in the lookup result was not checked before trying to populate
    headers  with data. If this field is not checked the provider could try to populate headers with wrong data, as per the
    documentation for the Maxmind library https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/blob/main/doc/libmaxminddb.md#mmdb_lookup_result_s.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where access log gets skipped for HTTP/3 requests when the stream is half closed. This behavior can be
    reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_fix_defer_logging_miss_for_half_closed_stream`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the premature resets of streams may result in the recursive draining and potential
    stack overflow. Setting proper ``max_concurrent_streams`` value for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 could eliminate
    the risk of the stack overflow before this fix.
- area: listeners
  change: |
    Fixed issue where :ref:`TLS inspector listener filter <config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>` timed out
    when used with other listener filters. The bug was triggered when a previous listener filter processed more data
    than the TLS inspector had requested, causing the TLS inspector to incorrectly calculate its buffer growth strategy.
    The fix ensures that buffer growth is now based on actual bytes available rather than the previously requested amount.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Adds missing session name, session duration and externalid parameters in assumerole credentials provider.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed a bug introduced in PR [#40228](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/40228), where OAuth2 cookies were
    removed for requests matching the ``pass_through_matcher`` configuration. This broke setups with multiple OAuth2
    filter instances using different ``pass_through_matcher`` configurations, because the first matching instance removed
    the OAuth2 cookies--even when a passthrough was intended--impacting subsequent filters that still needed those cookies.

new_features:
- area: stats
  change: |
    Added support to remove unused metrics from memory for extensions that
    support evictable metrics. This is done :ref:`periodically
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.stats_eviction_interval>`
    during the metric flush.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added new option to support :ref:`base64 encoded server ID
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.quic.connection_id_generator.quic_lb.v3.Config.server_id_base64_encoded>`
    in QUIC-LB.
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added support for request payloads in HTTP health checks. The ``send`` field in ``HttpHealthCheck`` can now be
    used to specify a request body to be sent during health checking. This feature supports both hex-encoded text
    and binary payloads, similar to TCP health checks. The payload can only be used with HTTP methods that support
    request bodies (``POST``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH``, ``OPTIONS``). Methods that must not have request bodies
    (``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``DELETE``, ``TRACE``) are validated and will throw an error if combined with payloads.
    The implementation is optimized to process the payload once during configuration and reuse it for all health
    check requests. See :ref:`HttpHealthCheck <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck>` for configuration details.
- area: router_check_tool
  change: |
    Added support for testing routes with :ref:`dynamic metadata matchers <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteMatch.dynamic_metadata>`
    in the router check tool. The tool now accepts a ``dynamic_metadata`` field in test input to set metadata
    that can be matched by route configuration. This allows comprehensive testing of routes that depend on
    dynamic metadata for routing decisions.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``filterState()`` on ``streamInfo()`` which provides access to filter state objects stored during request processing.
    This allows Lua scripts to retrieve string, boolean, and numeric values stored by various filters for use in routing decisions,
    header modifications, and other processing logic. See :ref:`Filter State API <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_filter_state_wrapper>`
    for more details.
- area: socket
  change: |
    Added ``network_namespace_filepath`` to :ref:`SocketAddress <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.SocketAddress>`. This field allows
    specifying a Linux network namespace filepath for socket creation, enabling network isolation in containerized environments.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Add the :ref:`rate_limits
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.rate_limits>`
    field to generate rate limit descriptors. If this field is set, the
    :ref:`VirtualHost.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` or
    :ref:`RouteAction.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.rate_limits>` fields will be ignored. However,
    :ref:`RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits>`
    will take precedence over this field.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for ``GEOSEARCH``and ``GETEX``.
- area: observability
  change: |
    Added ``ENVOY_NOTIFICATION`` macro to track specific conditions in produiction environments.
- area: dns_filter, redis_proxy and prefix_matcher_map
  change: |
    Switch to using Radix Tree instead of Trie for performance improvements.
- area: header_to_metadata
  change: |
    Added optional statistics collection for the Header-To-Metadata filter. When the :ref:`stat_prefix
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.header_to_metadata.v3.Config.stat_prefix>` field is configured,
    the filter emits detailed counters for rule processing, metadata operations, etc. See
    :ref:`Header-To-Metadata filter statistics <config_http_filters_header_to_metadata>` for details.
- area: load_reporting
  change: |
    Added support for endpoint-level load stats and metrics reporting. Locality load reports now include per
    endpoint statistics and metrics, but only for endpoints with updated stats, optimizing report size and efficiency.
- area: overload management
  change: |
        Added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.http2_server_go_away_and_close_on_dispatch``
        that sends ``GOAWAY`` AND closes connections for HTTP2 server processing of requests.  When
        a ``GOAWAY`` frame is submitted by this the counter ``http2.goaway_sent`` will be
        incremented.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`request_body_buffer_limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.request_body_buffer_limit>` and
    :ref:`request_body_buffer_limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.request_body_buffer_limit>` configuration fields
    to enable buffering of large request bodies beyond connection buffer limits.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Added support for resource attributes. The stat sink will use the resource attributes configured for the OpenTelemetry tracer via
    :ref:`resource_detectors <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.OpenTelemetryConfig.resource_detectors>`.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``virtualHost()`` to the Stream handle API, allowing Lua scripts to retrieve virtual host information. So far, the only method
    implemented is ``metadata()``, allowing Lua scripts to access virtual host metadata scoped to the specific filter name. See
    :ref:`Virtual host object API <config_http_filters_lua_virtual_host_wrapper>` for more details.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for per-route gRPC service override in the ``ext_authz`` HTTP filter. This allows different routes
    to use different external authorization backends by configuring a
    :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.CheckSettings.grpc_service>`
    in the per-route ``check_settings``. Routes without this configuration continue to use the default
    authorization service.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added :ref:`trace_context_option <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.ZipkinConfig.trace_context_option>` enum
    in the Zipkin tracer config. When set to ``USE_B3_WITH_W3C_PROPAGATION``, the tracer will:
    extract trace information from W3C trace headers when B3 headers are not present (downstream),
    and inject both B3 and W3C trace headers for upstream requests to maximize compatibility.
    The default value ``USE_B3`` maintains backward compatibility with B3-only behavior.
- area: composite
  change: |
    Allow composite filter to be configured to insert a filter into filter chain outside of the decode headers lifecycle phase.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Switch the IP matcher to use LC-Trie for performance improvements.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``route()`` to the Stream handle API, allowing Lua scripts to retrieve route information. So far, the only method
    implemented is ``metadata()``, allowing Lua scripts to access route metadata scoped to the specific filter name. See
    :ref:`Route object API <config_http_filters_lua_route_wrapper>` for more details.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Add a new %TYPED_CEL% formatter command that, unlike %CEL%, can output non-string values (number, boolean, null, etc)
    when used in formatting contexts that accept non-string values, such as
    :ref:`json_format <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SubstitutionFormatString.json_format>`. The new command is introduced
    so as to not break compatibility with the existing command's behavior.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added a new Logging ABI that allows modules to emit logs in the standard Envoy logging stream under "dynamic_modules" ID.
    In the Rust SDK, they are available as ``envoy_log_info``, etc.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added ``upstream_rq_per_cx`` histogram to track requests per connection for monitoring connection reuse efficiency.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added
    :ref:`stream_flush_timeout
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.stream_flush_timeout>`
    to allow for configuring a stream flush timeout independently from the stream idle timeout.
