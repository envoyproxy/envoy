behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: http2
  change: |
    Sets runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to true by default.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: dfp
  change:
    Fixes a bug when loading a DNS cache entry with an empty authority/host header. This fix can be reverted by setting
    runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_fail_on_empty_host_header`` to ``false``.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed query parameter matcher to properly implement
    :ref:`present_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.QueryParameterMatcher.present_match>`. Previously, the
    matcher would incorrectly handle ``present_match`` configurations by treating them as default present checks. This
    behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime feature
    ``envoy_reloadable_features_enable_new_query_param_present_match_behavior`` to ``false``.

new_features:
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Add the option to specify SameSite cookie attribute values for oauth2 supported cookies.
    To specify SameSite attribute, choose one of the values from ``strict``,``lax`` or ``none``. If not specified,
    a default value of ``disabled`` will be assigned and there will be no SameSite value in the cookie attribute. See
    :ref:`apply_on_stream_done <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.cookie_configs>`
    for more details.
- area: spiffe
  change: |
    Added :ref:`trust_bundles
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SPIFFECertValidatorConfig.trust_bundles>`
    to the SPIFFE certificate validator configuration. This field allows specifying a SPIFFE trust
    bundle mapping as a DataSource. If both trust_bundles and trust_domains are specified,
    trust_bundles takes precedence.
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    Added support to monitor Container CPU utilization in Linux K8s environment using existing
    extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.cpu_utilization.v3.CpuUtilizationConfig>.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added :ref:`virtualClusterName() <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_virtual_cluster_name>` API to the Stream Info
    Object to get the name of the virtual cluster matched.

    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_udp_proxy_outlier_detection`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Alpha support for asynchronous load balancing.  See <arch_overview_load_balancing_policies> for details. Support can

  change: |
    Adding support for a new body mode: FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED in the ext_proc filter
    :ref:`processing_mode <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.processing_mode>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`max_metadata_size <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_metadata_size>` to make
    HTTP/2 metadata limits configurable.
