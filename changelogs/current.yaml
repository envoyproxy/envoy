behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: aws_iam
  change: |
    As announced in November 2024 (see https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/37621), the
    ``grpc_credentials/aws_iam`` extension is being deleted. Any configuration referencing this extension
    will fail to load.
- area: prefix_match_map
  change: |
    :ref:`prefix_match_map <envoy_v3_api_field_config.common.matcher.v3.Matcher.MatcherTree.prefix_match_map>`
    now continues to search for a match with a shorter prefix if a longer match
    does not find an action. This brings it in line with the behavior of ``matcher_list``.
    This change can temporarily be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.prefix_map_matcher_resume_after_subtree_miss`` to ``false``.
    If the old behavior is desired more permanently, this can be achieved in config by setting
    an ``on_no_match`` action that responds with ``404`` for each subtree.
- area: server
  change: |
    Envoy will automatically raise the soft limit on the file descriptors to the hard limit. This behavior
    can be reverted using the runtime guard ``envoy_restart_features_raise_file_limits``.
- area: build
  change: |
    Removed the ``clang-libstdc++`` toolchain setup as this is no longer used or tested by the project.
    Consolidated Clang and GCC toolchains which can be used with ``--config=clang`` or ``--config=gcc``.
    These use ``libc++`` and ``libstdc++`` respectively.
- area: squash_filter
  change: |
    The Squash HTTP filter in ``contrib`` has been deleted. The project it provided integration with has been idle for
    five years and appears abandoned.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: geoip
  change: |
    The lookup for ASN information is fetched from ``asn_db`` if ``asn_db_path`` is defined and from ``isp_db`` if
    ``asn_db_path`` is not defined.
- area: lua
  change: |
    The ``metadata()`` of the Lua filter now will search the metadata by the :ref:`filter config name
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpFilter.name>` first.
    And if not found, it will search by the canonical name of the filter ``envoy.filters.http.lua``.
- area: grpc-json
  change: |
    Made the :ref:`gRPC JSON transcoder filter's <config_http_filters_grpc_json_reverse_transcoder>` JSON print options configurable.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Reset CSRF token when token validation fails during redirection.
    If the CSRF token cookie is present during the redirection to the authorization server, it will be validated.
    Previously, if this validation failed, the OAuth flow would fail. Now the CSRF token will simply be reset. This fixes
    the case where an HMAC secret change causes a redirect flow, but the CSRF token cookie hasn't yet expired
    causing a CSRF token validation failure.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Precompile regexes in CEL expressions. This can be disabled by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_cel_regex_precompilation`` to ``false``.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Allow ``getaddrinfo`` to be configured to run by a thread pool, controlled by :ref:`num_resolver_threads
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig.num_resolver_threads>`.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Honor the default DNS resolver configuration in the bootstrap config
    :ref:`typed_dns_resolver_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.typed_dns_resolver_config>`
    if the DNS cache configuration in the dynamic forward proxy filter is empty
    :ref:`dns_cache_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.FilterConfig.dns_cache_config>`.
- area: grpc-json-transcoding
  change: |
    Added SSE style message framing for streamed responses in :ref:`gRPC JSON transcoder filter <config_http_filters_grpc_json_transcoder>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    :ref:`response_headers_to_add <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.response_headers_to_add>` and
    :ref:`response_headers_to_remove <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.response_headers_to_remove>`
    will also be applied to the local responses from the ``envoy.filters.http.router`` filter.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added :ref:`max_cache_size <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.OpenTelemetryConfig.max_cache_size>`
    to the OpenTelemetry tracer config. This limits the number of spans that can be cached before flushing.
- area: aws
  change: |
    :ref:`AwsCredentialProvider <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.common.aws.v3.AwsCredentialProvider>` now supports all defined credential
    providers, allowing complete customization of the credential provider chain when using AWS request signing extension.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    If the ext_proc server sends a spurious response message to Envoy, Envoy now performs fail-open or fail-close action based on
    :ref:`failure_mode_allow <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.failure_mode_allow>`
    configuration. This change can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_proc_fail_close_spurious_resp`` to ``false``.
- area: filters
  change: |
    :ref:`Credential injector filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.credential_injector.v3.CredentialInjector>` is no longer
    a work in progress field.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    The access token, ID token and refresh token in the cookies are now encrypted using the HMAC secret. This behavior can
    be reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth2_encrypt_tokens`` to ``false``.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Validate HTTP/3 pseudo headers. Can be disabled by setting ``envoy.restart_features.validate_http3_pseudo_headers`` to ``false``.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Now the ``METADATA`` and ``CEL`` substitution formatters can access or log the metadata of
    the virtual host in case the route is not matched but the virtual host is found.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Extension status changed from ``alpha`` to ``stable``.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
      Starting from this release, these cookies: oauth_hmac,oauth_expires,refresh_token,oauth_nonce,code_verifier will
      not be forwarded to the upstream. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
      ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth2_cleanup_cookies`` to ``false``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: conn_pool
  change: |
    Fixed an issue that could lead to too many connections when using
    :ref:`AutoHttpConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.AutoHttpConfig>` if the
    established connection is HTTP/2 and Envoy predicted it would have lower concurrent capacity.
- area: conn_pool
  change: |
    Fixed an issue that could lead to insufficient connections for current pending requests. If a connection starts draining while it
    has negative unused capacity (which happens if an HTTP/2 ``SETTINGS`` frame reduces allowed concurrency to below the current number
    of requests), that connection's unused capacity will be included in total pool capacity even though it is unusable because it is
    draining. This can result in not enough connections being established for current pending requests. This is most problematic for
    long-lived requests (such as streaming gRPC requests or long-poll requests) because a connection could be in the draining state
    for a long time.
- area: hcm
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the lifetime of the ``HttpConnectionManager``'s ``ActiveStream`` can be out of sync
    with the lifetime of the codec stream.
- area: config_validation
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the config validation server will crash when the configuration contains
    ``%CEL%`` or ``%METADATA%`` substitution formatter.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fixed an issue with incorrectly cached connection properties on TLS connections.
    If TLS connection data was queried before it was available, an empty value was being incorrectly cached, preventing later calls from
    getting the correct value. This could be triggered with a ``tcp_proxy`` access log configured to emit a log upon connection
    establishment if the log contains fields of the TLS peer certificate. Then a later use of the data, such as the network RBAC
    filter validating a peer certificate SAN, may incorrectly fail due to the empty cached value.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in Envoy's HTTP/3-to-HTTP/1 proxying when a ``transfer-encoding`` header is incorrectly appended.
    Protected by runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_signal_headers_only_to_http1_backend``.
- area: runtime
  change: |
    Fixed a bug which resulted in an ``ENVOY_BUG`` being incorrectly triggered when runtime settings
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.max_request_headers_count``, ``envoy.reloadable_features.max_response_headers_count``,
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.max_request_headers_size_kb``, or ``envoy.reloadable_features.max_response_headers_size_kb`` were set.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where empty trusted CA file or inline string is accepted and causes Envoy to successfully validate any certificate
    chain. This fix addresses this issue by rejecting such configuration with empty value. This behavior can be reverted by setting
    the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_empty_trusted_ca_file`` to ``false``.
- area: tls_inspector
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the TLS inspector filter would not correctly report ``client_hello_too_large`` stat for too big client
    hello messages, i.e., bigger than 16 KB.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the Wasm filter hangs when the VM is crashed in the request callbacks.
- area: dynatrace
  change: |
    Fixed a division by zero bug in the Dynatrace sampling controller that occurred when ``total_wanted`` was less than
    ``top_k_size``. The calculation was refactored to avoid the intermediate division that could result in zero.

- area: stateful_session
  change: |
    Support for envelope stateful session extension to keep the existing session header value
    from upstream server. See :ref:`mode
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.stateful_session.envelope.v3.EnvelopeSessionState>`
    for more details.
- area: transport_tap

- area: load_balancing
  change: |
    Added Override Host Load Balancing policy. See
    :ref:`load balancing policies overview <arch_overview_load_balancing_policies>` for more details.
- area: load_balancing
  change: |
    Added :ref:`hash policy support
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.load_balancing_policies.common.v3.ConsistentHashingLbConfig.hash_policy>`
    to the ring hash and maglev load balancing policies. If the hash policy in the load balancer is
    configured, the
    :ref:`route level hash policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.hash_policy>`
    will be ignored.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added support for accessing filter context.
    See :ref:`filterContext() <config_http_filters_lua_stream_handle_api_filter_context>` for more details.
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    Added new cgroup memory resource monitor that reads memory usage/limit from cgroup v1/v2 subsystems and calculates
    memory pressure, with configurable ``max_memory_bytes`` limit
    :ref:`existing extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.cgroup_memory.v3.CgroupMemoryConfig>`.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added ``grpc_status`` to ``ExtAuthzLoggingInfo`` in ``ext_authz`` HTTP filter.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`response trailers mutations
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.header_mutation.v3.Mutations.response_trailers_mutations>` and
    :ref:`request trailers mutations
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.header_mutation.v3.Mutations.request_trailers_mutations>`
    to :ref:`Header Mutation Filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.header_mutation.v3.HeaderMutation>`
    for adding/removing trailers from the request and the response.
- area: postgres
  change: |
    Added support for requiring downstream SSL.
- area: url_template
  change: |
    Included the asterisk ``*`` in the match pattern when using the ``*`` or ``**`` operators in the URL template.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uri_template_match_on_asterisk`` to ``false``.
- area: socket
  change: |
    Added ``network_namespace_filepath`` to ``SocketAddress``. Currently only used by listeners.
- area: rbac_filter
  change: |
    Allow-listed ``FilterStateInput`` to be used with the xDS matcher in the HTTP RBAC filter.

  change: |
    Allow-listed ``FilterStateInput`` to be used with the xDS matcher in the Network RBAC filter.
- area: tls_inspector_filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`enable_ja4_fingerprinting

    a JA4 fingerprint hash from the Client Hello message.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    ``local_ratelimit`` will return ``x-ratelimit-reset`` header when the rate limit is exceeded.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added :ref:`end_session_endpoint <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.end_session_endpoint>`
    to the ``oauth2`` filter to support OIDC RP initiated logout. This field is only used when
    ``openid`` is in the :ref:`auth_scopes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.auth_scopes>` field.
    If configured, the OAuth2 filter will redirect users to this endpoint when they access the
    :ref:`signout_path <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.signout_path>`. This allows users to
    be logged out of the Authorization server.
- area: tcp_access_logs
  change: |
    Added support for ``%BYTES_RECEIVED%``, ``%BYTES_SENT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_HEADER_BYTES_SENT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_HEADER_BYTES_RECEIVED%``,
    ``%UPSTREAM_WIRE_BYTES_SENT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_WIRE_BYTES_RECEIVED%`` access log substitution strings for TCP tunneling flows.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added configurable :ref:`csrf_token_expires_in
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.csrf_token_expires_in>`
    and :ref:`code_verifier_token_expires_in
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.code_verifier_token_expires_in>`
    fields to the ``oauth2`` filter. Both default to ``600s`` (10 minutes) if not specified, keeping backward compatibility.
- area: load_shed_point
  change: |
    Added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.connection_pool_new_connection`` in the connection pool, and it will not
    create new connections when Envoy is under pressure, and the pending downstream requests will be cancelled.
- area: api_key_auth
  change: |
    Added :ref:`forwarding configuration <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.api_key_auth.v3.Forwarding>`
    to the API Key Auth filter, which allows forwarding the authenticated client identity
    using a custom header, and also offers the option to remove the API key from the request
    before forwarding.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``dynamicTypedMetadata()`` on ``connectionStreamInfo()`` which can be used to access the typed metadata from
    network filters, such as the Proxy Protocol, etc.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Implementation of `IAM Roles Anywhere support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html>`_ in the
    AWS common components, providing this capability to the AWS Lambda and AWS Request Signing extensions.
- area: redis
  change: |
    ``redis_proxy`` filter now supports AWS IAM Authentication.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added matcher based router cluster specifier plugin to support selecting cluster dynamically based on a matcher tree.
    See
    :ref:`matcher cluster specifier plugin <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.router.cluster_specifiers.matcher.v3.MatcherClusterSpecifier>`
    for more details.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added new ``refreshRouteCluster()`` method to stream filter callbacks to support refreshing the route cluster and
    does not need to update the route cache. See :ref:`http route mutation <arch_overview_http_filters_route_mutation>` for
    more details.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``dynamicTypedMetadata()`` on ``streamInfo()`` which can be used to access the typed metadata from
    HTTP filters, such as the Set Metadata filter, etc.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added a new ``failure_mode_deny_percent`` field of type ``Envoy::Runtime::FractionalPercent`` attached to the rate
    limit filter to configure the failure mode for rate limit service errors in runtime.
    It acts as an override for the existing ``failure_mode_deny`` field in the filter config.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added new metric for emitting seconds since UNIX epoch of expirations of TLS and CA certificates.
    They are rooted at ``cluster.<cluster_name>.ssl.certificate.<cert_name>.``
    and at ``listener.<address>.ssl.certificate.<cert_name>.`` namespace.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    The :ref:`failure_mode_allow <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.failure_mode_allow>`
    setting may now be overridden on a per-route basis.
- area: matcher
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`ServerNameMatcher <envoy_v3_api_msg_.xds.type.matcher.v3.ServerNameMatcher>` trie-based matching.
- area: stateful_session
  change: |
    Added support for cookie attributes to stateful session cookie.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Added :ref:`disable_connection_flow_control_for_streams
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http3ProtocolOptions.disable_connection_flow_control_for_streams>`, an experimental
    option for disabling connection level flow control for streams. This is useful in situations where the streams share the same
    connection but originate from different end-clients, so that each stream can make progress independently at non-front-line proxies.
- area: dfp
  change: |
    Added :ref:`allow_dynamic_host_from_filter_state
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.FilterConfig.allow_dynamic_host_from_filter_state>`
    flag to HTTP Dynamic Forward Proxy filter. When enabled, the filter will check for ``envoy.upstream.dynamic_host`` and
    ``envoy.upstream.dynamic_port`` filter state values before using the HTTP Host header, providing consistency with SNI
    and UDP DFP filters. When disabled (default), maintains backward compatibility by using the HTTP Host header directly.
- area: alts
  change: |
    Added environment variable-protected gRPC keepalive params to the ALTS handshaker client.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Added support for returning ``StopIteration`` from plugin ``onRequestHeader`` and ``onResponseHeader`` callbacks. See
    :ref:`allow_on_headers_stop_iteration <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.wasm.v3.PluginConfig.allow_on_headers_stop_iteration>`
    for more details. By default, current behavior is maintained.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Added ``assume_role_credential_provider`` to add support for role chaining in AWS filters. This allows envoy to
    assume an additional role before SigV4 signing occurs.
