behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: listener
  change: |
    Previously a listener update with different :ref:`transparent <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.transparent>`, :ref:`freebind <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.freebind>`,
    :ref:`tcp_fast_open_queue_length <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.tcp_fast_open_queue_length>` or :ref:`socket_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.socket_options>` was ignored.
    Now, when those fields are updated, a new socket will be created for
    the listener and the new value of those fields applied to it. This only happens when :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>` is true.
    Otherwise if those fields change the update is rejected.
    New runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_update_listener_socket_options`` can be used for revert this behavior.
- area: build
  change: |
    removed the cares and apple resolvers as required extensions. Envoy now only creates DNS resolvers when necessary (e.g. for logical DNS cluster) so does not require cares to always be included. If your Envoys do DNS resolution and you override extensions_build_config you will need to include cares explicitly.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Previously a listener update with different :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>` value will be ignored. Now,
    this kind of update will be rejected. The runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_update_listener_socket_options`` can be used for revert this behavior.
- area: build
  change: |
    moved the strict_dns, original_dst, logical_dns, static, and eds clusters to extensions. If you use these clusters and override extensions_build_config.bzl you will now need to include it explicitly.
- area: stats http ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed ext_authz metric tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    envoy_http_ext_authz_prefixval_denied{} to envoy_http_ext_authz_denied{envoy_ext_authz_prefix="prefixval"}.
    envoy_cluster_X_ext_authz_Y_denied follows the same pattern.
- area: loadbalancing
  change: |
    When active HC is enabled per cluster, slow start calculation now starts after first passing HC. Cluster membership duration condition is dropped from slow start calculation.
    Endpoint can now re-enter slow start if active HC is configured per cluster, on each "unhealthy -> healthy" state transition.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: tls
  change: |
    added support for intermediate CA as trusted ca. The peer certificate issued by an intermediate CA will be trusted by
    building valid partial chain. In old days, it can not be verified without trusting its ancestor root CA and building
    a full chain.
    :ref:`trust_ca<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.trusted_ca>`.
    This change can be reverted via the ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_intermediate_ca``.

- area: cache_filter
  change: |
    add a completion callback to updateHeaders interface. Any external cache implementations will need to update to match this new interface. See changes to simple_http_cache in PR#23666 for example.
- area: cache_filter
  change: |
    api path of work-in-progress extension changed from ``api/extensions/cache/simple_http_cache`` to ``api/extensions/http/cache/simple_http_cache``, and source code moved, to match extension category.
- area: http filters
  change: |
    change ``StreamEncoderFilter::encode1xxHeaders`` to use its own enum class ``Http::Filter1xxHeadersStatus``. Previously we shared the same enum class for general headers, but the implementation did not support most of them. We also fixed ``StreamEncoderFilter::encode1xxHeaders`` to send local replies without trailing 1xx headers afterward.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Requests which match the passthrough header now have their own metric ``oauth_passthrough`` and aren't included in ``oauth_success`` anymore.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    detailed health status is used for override host selection. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.validate_detailed_override_host_statuses`` to false.
- area: rate_limit
  change: |
    add ``MONTH`` and ``YEAR`` to the unit of time for rate limit.
- area: router
  change: |
    Virtual cluster statistics are no longer created for routes without any ``virtual_clusters``. Previously statistics for a ``catch all`` virtual cluster were created, but never updated.
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    adjust the refetch time for remote_jwks async_fetch feature. For a good fetch, refetch 5 seconds before jwks cache duration. For a failed fetch, refetch time can be specified by :ref:`failed_refetch_duration <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.jwt_authn.v3.JwksAsyncFetch.failed_refetch_duration>` with default 1 second.
- area: http
  change: |
    reverting the behavioral change to have ``CONNECT`` and upgrade requests over HTTP/1.1 not delay close.  One can reinstate
    delay close for upgrades by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_delay_close_for_upgrades`` to ``true``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: aws_lambda
  change: |
    fix a bug when :ref:`PerRouteConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.aws_lambda.v3.PerRouteConfig>` is defined and was routing to a target cluster's AWS Lambda endpoint
    in a region that is different from the region obtained in :ref:`arn <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.aws_lambda.v3.Config.arn>` of aws_lambda http_filter configuration
    then the authorization header included in the request towards AWS Lambda was not signed with the region specified in PerRouteConfig.
- area: grpc_json_transcoder
  change: |
    fix a bug when using http2, request body has google.api.HttpBody and the size is < 16KB, it will cause EOF from the backend grpc server.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed a bug that incorrectly rewrote the path when using ``regex_rewrite`` for redirects matched on prefix.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    fixed a bug when passthrough header was matched, envoy would always remove the authorization header. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_header_passthrough_fix`` to false.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    fixed a bug that encoder filters and decoder filters of generic proxy will be executed in the same order. The encoder filters' execuate order should be the reverse of decoder filters' in the generic proxy.
- area: quic
  change: |
    reject configs that specify require_client_certificate with QUIC since clients certificates are currently unsupported in QUIC. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_require_client_certificate_with_quic`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a bug where Utility::PercentEncoding::encode() encodes some characters incorrectly because it was treating the value as negative.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    fixed a bug that only coarse health status is used for override host selection.
- area: validation
  change: |
    fixed a crash which could happen when optional ``engine_type`` is not provided in regex.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    fixed a bug when specify both a single address in bootstrap and cluster upstream binding config but with a different IP version. It should be allowed but it is rejected.
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    fix a bug that jwt_cache breaks the :ref:`provider_and_audiences <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.jwt_authn.v3.JwtRequirement.provider_and_audiences>` JWT requirement.
