behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: healthcheck
  change: |
    If active HC is enabled and a host is ejected by outlier detection, a successful active health check unejects the host and consider it healthy. This also clears all the outlier detection counters. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features_successful_active_health_check_uneject_host`` to ``false``.

- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    Tokens from local descriptor's token buckets are burned before tokens from the default token bucket.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: stats
  change: |
    now updating upstream total connection stats as happy eyeballs connections are created.
- area: eds
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.multiplex_eds`` to disable eds multiplexing. Eds multiplexing is enabled by default, so that all subscriptions for the same resource type and management server reuse a single channel/mux.
    When eds multiplexing is disabled each subscription uses a dedicated channel/mux.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`
- area: router
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.get_route_config_factory_by_type`` runtime flag. The flag is no longer needed as the behavior is now the default.
- area: http
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_delay_keepalive_timeout`` and legacy code paths.

- area: http
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_rfc_connect`` and legacy code path.
- area: http
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_concurrency_for_alpn_pool`` and legacy code path.

new_features:
- area: tracing
  change: |
    allow :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.OpenTelemetryConfig.grpc_service>` to be optional. This enables a means to disable collection of traces.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added :ref:`ring hash extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.ring_hash.v3.RingHash>` to suppport the :ref:`load balancer policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.load_balancing_policy>`.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added :ref:`maglev extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.maglev.v3.Maglev>` to suppport the :ref:`load balancer policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.load_balancing_policy>`.
