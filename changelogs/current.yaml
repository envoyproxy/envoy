- area: health_check
  change: |
    Fixed a race condition where active health checks could start before required upstream TLS SDS secrets
    were fetched, causing intermittent health check failures `#43116 <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/43116>`_.
    This fix can be disabled by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.health_check_after_cluster_warming``
    to ``false``.
