behavior_changes:
- area: tls-inspector
  change: |
    the listener filter tls inspector's stats ``connection_closed`` and ``read_error`` are removed. The new stats are introduced for listener, ``downstream_peek_remote_close`` and ``read_error`` :ref:`listener stats <config_listener_stats>`.

minor_behavior_changes:
- area: thrift
  change: |
    add validate_clusters in :ref:`RouteConfiguration <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.v3.RouteConfiguration>` to override the default behavior of cluster validation.
- area: tls
  change: |
    if both :ref:`match_subject_alt_names <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_subject_alt_names>` and :ref:`match_typed_subject_alt_names <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_typed_subject_alt_names>` are specified, the former (deprecated) field is ignored. Previously, setting both fields would result in an error.
- area: tls
  change: |
    removed SHA-1 and RSA key transport cipher suites from the server-side defaults.
- area: http
  change: |
    the behavior of the :ref:`timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.KeepaliveSettings.timeout>`
    field has been modified to extend the timeout when *any* frame is received on the owning HTTP/2
    connection. This negates the effect of head-of-line (HOL) blocking for slow connections. If
    any frame is received the assumption is that the connection is working. This behavior change
    can be reverted by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_delay_keepalive_timeout`` runtime
    flag to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    changing the behavior for CONNECT and upgrade requests over HTTP/1.1 to not delay close. This behavioral change
    can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_delay_close_for_upgrades`` to false.
- area: http-cache
  change: |
    http cache filter ``getCache`` interface changed from returning a reference to
    returning a shared_ptr - any third-party implementations of this interface will need to be
    updated accordingly. See changes to ``simple_http_cache.cc`` and ``simple_http_cache.h`` in
    `PR21114 <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/21114>`_ for example.
- area: lua
  change: |
    export symbols of LuaJit by default on Linux. This is useful in cases where you have a lua script
    that loads shared object libraries, such as those installed via luarocks.
- area: admin
  change: |
    changed default regex engine for /stats?filter= from std::regex to RE2, improving filtering speed
    20x.
- area: skywalking
  change: |
    use request path as operation name of ENTRY/EXIT spans.
- area: skywalking
  change: |
    use upstream host address as ``addressUsedAtClient`` in propagation header.
- area: dns
  change: |
    allow propagating DNS responses with no records back to callers like strict_dns cluster,
    guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.cares_accept_nodata``.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    local_ratelimit will consume tokens of all matched descriptors sorted by tokens per second.
    This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_local_ratelimit_match_all_descriptors`` to false.
- area: router
  change: |
    get route config factories by the configuration proto full names by default. This behavior change
    can be reverted by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.get_route_config_factory_by_type``
    runtime flag to false.
  change: |
    add an ignore_port_in_host_matching config entry in RouteConfiguration. When set to true, port number(if any) in host
    header is ignored during host matching.
- area: lua
  change: |
    lua ``respond`` api will call ``sendLocalReply`` instead of ``encodeHeaders`` and ``encodeData``.
    This means that encoder filters will be correctly invoked, including adding configured response
    headers, etc. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.lua_respond_with_send_local_reply`` to false.

bug_fixes:
- area: runtime
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where was ``envoy.restart_features.no_runtime_singleton`` was inverted.
    Runtime singleton status is now guarded by non-inverted ``envoy.restart_features.remove_runtime_singleton``.

- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed an issue using the cluster wide CONNECT termination so it will successfully proxy payloads.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Fixed metric tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.stat_prefix>`
    is properly extracted.

- area: upstream
  change: |
    Fixed the LOGICAL_DNS and STRICT_DNS clusters to work for IPv6.

removed_config_or_runtime:
- area: compressor
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.fix_added_trailers`` and legacy code paths.
- area: dns
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_dns_ttl`` and legacy code paths.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_ext_authz_do_not_skip_direct_response_and_redirect`` runtime guard and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    deprecated ``envoy.reloadable_features.correct_scheme_and_xfp`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    deprecated ``envoy.reloadable_features.validate_connect`` and legacy code paths.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.new_tcp_connection_pool`` and legacy code paths.
- area: tls
  change: |
    fixed a bug when a certificate is invalid, ``days_until_expiration`` reports a big number. After this fix, when a certificate expires, it reports as ``0``.
- area: conn pool
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.conn_pool_delete_when_idle`` and legacy code paths.
- area: runtime
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.restart_features.no_runtime_singleton`` and replaced with ``envoy.restart_features.remove_runtime_singleton``.

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added new access_log command operators to retrieve upstream connection information change: ``%UPSTREAM_PROTOCOL%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_SUBJECT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_ISSUER%``, ``%UPSTREAM_TLS_SESSION_ID%``, ``%UPSTREAM_TLS_CIPHER%``, ``%UPSTREAM_TLS_VERSION%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_CERT_V_START%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_CERT_V_END%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_CERT%` and ``%UPSTREAM_FILTER_STATE%``.
- area: dns_resolver
  change: |
    added :ref:`include_unroutable_families<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.apple.v3.AppleDnsResolverConfig.include_unroutable_families>` to the Apple DNS resolver.
  change: |
    added support for multiple addresses. This is most valuable when used in conjunction with :ref:`ALL <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.DnsLookupFamily.ALL>` enabling full happy eyeballs support for Envoy (see detailed documentation :ref:`here <arch_overview_conn_pool>` but will also result in trying multiple addresses for resolvers doing only IPv4 or IPv6. This behavioral change can be temporarily disabled by setting runtime guard ``envoy.restart_features.remove_runtime_singleton`` to false.
- area: dubbo_proxy
  change: |
    added :ref:`dynamic routes discovery <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.DubboProxy.drds>` support to the dubbo proxy.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    added support for per-route :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExtProcOverrides.grpc_service>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    added new :ref:`file_system_buffer <config_http_filters_file_system_buffer>` http filter.
- area: http
  change: |
    preserve case header formatter support innner formatter on Envoy headers in :ref:`formatter_type_on_envoy_headers <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.http.header_formatters.preserve_case.v3.PreserveCaseFormatterConfig.formatter_type_on_envoy_headers>`.
- area: http3
  change: |
    added :ref:`early_data_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.early_data_policy>` extension to allow upstream HTTP/3 sending requests over early data. If no extension is configured, HTTP/3 pool will send safe requests as early data to the host if the pool already cached 0-RTT credentials of that host. If those requests fail and the underlying connection pool supports TCP fallback, the request may be retried automatically. If the :ref:`default extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.early_data.v3.DefaultEarlyDataPolicy>` is configured, no requests are allowed to be sent as early data. Note that if any customized extension configures non-safe requests to be allowed over early data, the Envoy will not automatically retry them. If desired, explicitly config their :ref:`retry_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.retry_policy>`. This feature requires both ``envoy.reloadable_features.conn_pool_new_stream_with_early_data_and_http3`` and ``envoy.reloadable_features.http3_sends_early_data`` to be turned on.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added flag to router to control downstream local close. :ref:`close_downstream_on_upstream_error <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.router.v3.Router.close_downstream_on_upstream_error>`.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added support for access logging.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added support for preserving header keys.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added support onLocalReply to inform filters of local replies.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    introduced thrift configurable encoder and bidirectional filters, which allows peeking and modifying the thrift response message.
- area: on_demand
  change: |
    :ref:`OnDemand <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.on_demand.v3.OnDemand>` got extended to hold configuration for on-demand cluster discovery. A similar message for :ref:`per-route configuration <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.on_demand.v3.PerRouteConfig>` is also added.
- area: proxy_protcol
  change: |
    added :ref:`allow_requests_without_proxy_protocol<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.listener.proxy_protocol.v3.ProxyProtocol.allow_requests_without_proxy_protocol>` to allow requests without proxy protocol on the listener from trusted downstreams as an opt-in flag.
- area: udp
  change: |
    added config to specify the UDP packet writer factory. See :ref:`udp_packet_packet_writer_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.UdpListenerConfig.udp_packet_packet_writer_config>`.
- area: build
  change: |
    enabled building arm64 envoy-distroless and envoy-tools :ref:`docker images <install_binaries>`.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`masked_remote_address <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RateLimit.Action.masked_remote_address>`.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`HTTP matching input functions <arch_overview_matching_api>` as descriptor producers.
- area: build
  change: |
    official released binary is now built with Clang 14.0.0.
- area: conn pool
  change: |
    Changed HTTP/2 connection pooling and the :ref:`ALPN pool <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.auto_config>` to remember the number of streams allowed by the endpoint and cap multiplexed streams for subsequent connections based on that. With that working, defaulted the ALPN pool to assume HTTP/2 will work, as it will only incur a latency hit once until the TLS handshake is complete, and then will cache that the effective stream limit is 1.  This behavioral change can be revered by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_concurrency_for_alpn_pool`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    added :ref:`cluster_header <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.cluster_header>` in :ref:`request_mirror_policies <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.request_mirror_policies>` to allow routing shadow request to the cluster specified in the request_header.
- area: router
  change:
    added :ref:`keep_empty_value <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HeaderValueOption.keep_empty_value>` to allow keeping empty values in custom headers.
- area: dubbo_proxy
  change: |
    added :ref:`metadata_match <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.RouteAction.metadata_match>` support to the dubbo proxy.

deprecated:
- area: dubbo_proxy
  change: |
    deprecated :ref:`old dubbo route config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.DubboProxy.route_config>`. Please use
    :ref:`multiple route config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.DubboProxy.multiple_route_config>` or
    :ref:`multiple route config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.DubboProxy.drds>` first.
