behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: server
  change: |
    Added container-aware CPU detection on Linux that respects cgroup CPU limits alongside hardware thread count
    and CPU affinity when ``--concurrency`` is not set. Envoy now uses the minimum of hardware threads, CPU affinity,
    and cgroup CPU limits to size worker threads by default, improving resource utilization in cgroup-limited
    containers. This behavior can be disabled by setting ``ENVOY_CGROUP_CPU_DETECTION`` to ``false`` to restore the
    previous hardware thread and affinity-based sizing. Uses conservative floor rounding to leave capacity for
    non-worker threads, which may reduce the total number of connections.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Updated the dynamic module ABI to support streaming body manipulation and fixed incorrect behavior when
    accessing or modifying request or response bodies. See https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/40918
    for details.
- area: http
  change: |
    Changed the default reset code from ``NO_ERROR`` to ``INTERNAL_ERROR``. This change can be reverted by setting the
    runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.reset_with_error`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Changed the default reset behavior when an upstream protocol error occurs. In the previous behavior, Envoy would
    propagate the upstream protocol error to the downstream client. In the new behavior, Envoy will ignore the upstream
    protocol error. This change can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.reset_ignore_upstream_reason`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_early_connect_data`` to reject ``CONNECT`` requests that send
    data before Envoy returns a ``200`` response. This non-compliant behavior is common for latency reduction, so the
    option is disabled by default.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`host_rewrite <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.host_rewrite>` and
    :ref:`path_rewrite <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.path_rewrite>` to
    :ref:`RouteAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteAction>` to support substitution formatting for host and
    path header rewriting.
- area: overload_manager
  change: |
    Fixed :ref:`downstream connections monitor
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>` to trigger
    configured actions and emit a ``pressure`` metric like other resource monitors. Previously, actions never triggered.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    The :ref:`request header custom tag <envoy_v3_api_field_type.tracing.v3.CustomTag.request_header>` now only
    supports fetching values from HTTP request headers. Non-HTTP protocols must use the substitution formatter-based
    :ref:`custom tag value <envoy_v3_api_field_type.tracing.v3.CustomTag.value>`. This behavior can be reverted by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.get_header_tag_from_header_map`` to ``false``.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added sequence number per event in transport socket streamed trace.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Changed the last sequence number from sentinel value to the previous sequence number plus one.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing request-specific details allows grouping by
    failure type. Detailed messages remain available in debug logs.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Close the gRPC stream when Envoy detects no further external processing is needed. This currently excludes ``BUFFERED``
    and ``BUFFERED_PARTIAL`` modes and a few corner cases, which close the stream during filter destruction. This behavior
    can be reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_proc_stream_close_optimization`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Check response header count and size after applying mutations and send a local reply if limits are exceeded.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed the HTTP ext_authz client to respect user-configured ``retry_on`` in
    :ref:`retry_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.RetryPolicy.retry_on>`. Previously, the value was overridden
    with ``5xx,gateway-error,connect-failure,reset``. Controlled by runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_authz_http_client_retries_respect_user_retry_on`` (defaults to ``true``); set to
    ``false`` to preserve the old behavior.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed HTTP ext_authz service to propagate headers (such as ``set-cookie``) back to clients. The filter now uses
    ``allowed_client_headers`` for denied responses and ``allowed_client_headers_on_success`` for successful responses.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Switched to QUICHE-provided migration logic to handle port migration on path degradation and migration to the server
    preferred address. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_migration_in_quiche`` to ``false``.
- area: mobile
  change: |
    Use mobile-specific network observer registries to propagate network change signals. This behavior can be reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.mobile_use_network_observer_registry`` to ``false``.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Fixed rejection of the truncation-length specifier for ``DYNAMIC_METADATA():Z`` in access log format strings. The
    length parameter now truncates strings and other value types; structured data types are not truncated.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Execute foreign functions on the effective context, when set by Wasm SDKs. Previously, foreign functions called from
    HTTP or gRPC callbacks could receive a root context instead of a stream context. This behavior can be reverted by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.wasm_use_effective_ctx_for_foreign_functions`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added ``immediate_responses_sent`` counter to the ext_proc filter stats in the
    ``http.<stat_prefix>.ext_proc.`` namespace.
- area: http
  change: |
    The :ref:`route level body buffer limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.request_body_buffer_limit>` is now applied to requests when
    the route is matched. Previously, it was only applied when the router filter is reached.
- area: http
  change: |
    Retrying of async HTTP client calls now respects the set buffer limits and the retry will be ignored
    if the buffer limit is exceeded. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_async_client_retry_respect_buffer_limits`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added ``server_half_closed`` counter to the ext_proc filter stats in the
    ``http.<stat_prefix>.ext_proc.`` namespace.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: adaptive concurrency
  change: |
    Fixed a race condition in the gradient controller that allowed more outstanding requests than the concurrency limit,
    bounded by the number of worker threads.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Fixed a memory leak when an HTTP/2 stream was reset before request headers were sent (for example, if an upstream
    HTTP filter sent a local reply after the connection was established but before headers were sent).
- area: http2
  change: |
    Optimized HTTP/2 header processing by avoiding allocations and string copies for well-known header names. Common
    headers (``:method``, ``:path``, ``:status``, ``content-type``, ``user-agent``, etc.) now reference static strings,
    reducing allocations and improving performance.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Fixed a crash when Lua filters set the response body to a payload larger than the body buffer limit.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added missing conversion support to ensure tapped messages are handled correctly for multi-event submissions.
- area: bootstrap
  change: |
    Fixed a startup crash when custom :ref:`header_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.header_prefix>`
    was set.
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fixed a crash in the TCP connection pool during downstream teardown when large requests or responses triggered flow
    control.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed ``shouldDrainConnectionUponCompletion()`` to send ``GOAWAY`` frames for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 instead of
    aggressively closing connections, preventing interrupted response bodies and ``ERR_DRAINING`` client errors.
    HTTP/1.1 behavior is unchanged.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed cases where addresses could be moved from the data packet being processed.
- area: composite
  change: |
    Fixed per-route configuration for the composite filter to match on response headers and trailers. Previously,
    matchers using ``HttpResponseHeaderMatchInput`` or ``HttpResponseTrailerMatchInput`` silently failed, skipping the
    delegated filter.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed a regression where router-set headers (for example, ``x-envoy-expected-rq-timeout-ms``,
    ``x-envoy-attempt-count``) were not accessible in ``request_headers_to_add`` on the initial request. These headers
    can now be referenced via formatters such as ``%REQ(x-envoy-expected-rq-timeout-ms)%``.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed an upstream HTTP filter issue when a route retried on 5xx and the filter returned
    ``FilterHeadersStatus::StopIteration`` in ``encodeHeaders()``.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the :ref:`vhost per request buffer limit bytes
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.per_request_buffer_limit_bytes>`
    will take precedence over the :ref:`route per request buffer limit bytes
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.per_request_buffer_limit_bytes>`.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Fixed missing attributes based on request headers (for example, ``request.host``) when ext_proc was configured to run
    only on the encode path.
- area: http_11_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed http_11_proxy transport socket buffering of bytes written after the initial HTTP ``CONNECT`` request was sent
    but before the response was received, which could buffer until connection timeout.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a connection leak in TCP proxy when ``receive_before_connect`` is enabled and the downstream connection closes
    before the upstream connection is established.
- area: connection
  change: |
    Fixed connection handling to propagate transport failure reasons to ``StreamInfo`` before close events, ensuring
    ``connection.transport_failure_reason`` and ``DOWNSTREAM_TRANSPORT_FAILURE_REASON`` are populated for all connection
    types.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Changed web identity token file watching in AWS signing components to pick up rotated tokens.
- area: dns_resolver
  change: |
    Removed unnecessary ``getifaddrs()`` system calls when ``filter_unroutable_families`` is disabled.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fixed truncation of ``OTHERNAME`` SANs with embedded null octets in TLS certificates, which caused incorrect SAN
    validation.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a remote ``jwt_auth`` token fetch crash when two or more auth headers were present and
    ``allow_missing_or_failed`` was set.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in the OAuth2 filter that caused multiple concurrent login flows to interfere with each other. This could
    lead to incorrect behavior when multiple requests initiated seperate OAuth2 logins at the same time.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Fixed a soundness bug in the Rust SDK by tightening bounds on the ``HttpFilterConfig`` trait.
- area: sds
  change: |
    Fixed SDS to enable auto-recovery when initial certificate file loading fails. Previously, if certificate
    files did not exist during initial SDS configuration, no file watch callbacks were set up, preventing
    automatic recovery when files appeared later.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Fixed transport socket matcher to correctly use downstream connection filter state for matching and optimized the
    selection path to avoid per-connection resolution overhead when filter state input is not used.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed the gRPC ext_authz client to respect ``status_on_error`` configuration when gRPC calls fail.
    Previously, gRPC call failures always returned 403 Forbidden regardless of the configured error status.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.router_filter_resetall_on_local_reply`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: composite filter
  change: |
    Added support for configuring a chain of filters in the composite filter's :ref:`ExecuteFilterAction
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.composite.v3.ExecuteFilterAction>` via the ``filter_chain`` field.
- area: composite filter
  change: |
    Added support for named filter chains in the :ref:`Composite
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.composite.v3.Composite>` filter config via the
    ``named_filter_chains`` field. These pre-compiled filter chains can be referenced from match
    actions using the ``filter_chain_name`` field in :ref:`ExecuteFilterAction
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.composite.v3.ExecuteFilterAction>`. This improves
    scalability by allowing filter chains to be defined once and referenced across many match actions.
- area: server
  change: |
    Added command-line option ``--file-flush-min-size-kb <integer>`` to configure the minimum size in kilobytes for log file flushing.
- area: network_filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`geoip network filter <config_network_filters_geoip>` to perform geolocation lookups
    at the network layer and store results in filter state. This enables geolocation data to be
    used for access logging, routing, and other purposes without requiring HTTP traffic.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added support for configuring cookie path in the OAuth2 filter. The :ref:`path
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.CookieConfig.path>` field can now be set
    for each cookie type to control the scope of OAuth2 cookies.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Added support for loading dynamic modules globally by setting :ref:`load_globally
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig.load_globally>` to ``true``.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Added :ref:`network filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleNetworkFilter>`
    support for dynamic modules, enabling TCP stream processing with dynamic modules.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Added :ref:`listener filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.listener.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleListenerFilter>`
    support for dynamic modules, enabling connection inspection and protocol detection before connection establishment.
- area: http filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`transform http filter <config_http_filters_transform>` to modify request and response bodies in any
    position of the HTTP filter chain. This also makes it possible to refresh routes based on attributes in the request
    body.
- area: matcher
  change: |
    Removed work-in-progress annotations from RBAC filter ``matcher`` and ``shadow_matcher`` fields in HTTP and network
    filters, marking the feature stable.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added process-level rate limiting on access log emission via
    :ref:`ProcessRateLimitFilter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.access_loggers.filters.process_ratelimit.v3.ProcessRateLimitFilter>`.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added :ref:`COALESCE <config_access_log_format_coalesce>` substitution formatter operator that evaluates multiple
    formatter operators in sequence and returns the first non-null result. This enables fallback behavior such as
    using SNI when available but falling back to the ``:authority`` header when SNI is not set.
- area: listener_filters
  change: |
    Added :ref:`Postgres Inspector <config_listener_filters_postgres_inspector>` listener filter for detecting
    PostgreSQL connections, extracting metadata, and supporting SNI-based routing for PostgreSQL traffic.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Enhanced dynamic module ABIs to support header addition and body size retrieval. See the latest ABI header for
    details.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Added support for streamable HTTP callouts in dynamic modules. Modules can create streaming HTTP connections to
    upstream clusters using ``start_http_stream``, send request data and trailers incrementally, and receive streaming
    response headers, data, and trailers through dedicated callbacks.
- area: udp_sink
  change: |
    Enhanced the UDP sink to support tapped messages larger than 64KB.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Marked :ref:`filter_chain_matcher <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.filter_chain_matcher>` as stable
    by removing the work-in-progress annotation. The xDS matcher API for filter chain selection has been thoroughly
    tested and is ready for production use.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Added support for configuring TCP keepalive settings on both primary and additional addresses
    by setting :ref:`tcp_keepalive <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.tcp_keepalive>`
    and :ref:`additional address tcp_keepalive <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.AdditionalAddress.tcp_keepalive>`.
    Setting any keepalive field to ``0`` disables TCP keepalive for that address (or for the
    listener and inherited additional addresses when only the listener keepalive is configured).
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added a new :ref:`access logger <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.access_loggers.stats.v3.Config>` that emits
    configurable metrics.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Fixed ``start_time_unix_nano`` for exported metrics.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Added support for dropping stats via
    :ref:`DropAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.stat_sinks.open_telemetry.v3.SinkConfig.DropAction>` during
    custom metric conversion.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`error_response <envoy_v3_api_field_service.auth.v3.CheckResponse.error_response>` in the
    external authorization API. Authorization services can return custom HTTP status codes, headers, and response bodies
    on internal errors, reusing :ref:`DeniedHttpResponse <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.auth.v3.DeniedHttpResponse>`.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added :ref:`upstream_connect_mode
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.upstream_connect_mode>`
    and :ref:`max_early_data_bytes
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.max_early_data_bytes>`
    to control when upstream connections are established and early data buffering behavior.
    This enables use cases like extracting TLS certificate information or SNI before establishing
    upstream connections.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`vhost_header <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteConfiguration.vhost_header>` to
    :ref:`RouteConfiguration <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteConfiguration>` to allow using a different header
    for vhost matching.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Added a parameter to ``sendGoAwayAndClose`` to support graceful closure of HTTP/2 connections.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Added :ref:`enable_huffman_encoding
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http2ProtocolOptions.enable_huffman_encoding>` which controls
    whether to use huffman encoding when sending headers. This is useful in scenarios where the
    bandwidth saved from huffman encoding is not worth the CPU cost, e.g., for localhost, sidecar
    traffic.
- area: logging
  change: |
    Added support for the not-equal operator in access log filter rules via
    :ref:`ComparisonFilter <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.accesslog.v3.ComparisonFilter>`.
- area: c-ares
  change: |
    Added optional ``reinit_channel_on_timeout`` to the c-ares resolver to reinitialize the channel after DNS timeouts.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Added per-expression configuration options for the CEL evaluator to control string conversion, concatenation, and
    string extension functions. CEL expressions in RBAC policies and access log filters can enable functions such as
    ``replace()`` and ``split()`` through new :ref:`cel_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.rbac.v3.Policy.cel_config>` and
    :ref:`cel_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.access_loggers.filters.cel.v3.ExpressionFilter.cel_config>` fields.
    See :ref:`CelExpressionConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.CelExpressionConfig>` for details.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added support for the following new access log formatters:

    #. ``%REQUEST_HEADER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%REQ(X?Y):Z%``.
    #. ``%RESPONSE_HEADER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%RESP(X?Y):Z%``.
    #. ``%RESPONSE_TRAILER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%TRAILER(X?Y):Z%``.

    This provides a more consistent naming scheme for users to understand and use.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added new :ref:`value <envoy_v3_api_field_type.tracing.v3.CustomTag.value>` field and support for
    :ref:`substitution format specifier <config_access_log_format>` to extract values from request and response data for
    custom tags.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added new :ref:`tracing operation
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.operation>`
    and :ref:`upstream tracing operation
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.upstream_operation>`
    fields in the tracing configuration to set custom operation names for spans with the
    substitution format specifier.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    Added custom substitution format specifier support in tracing custom tags for the
    :ref:`generic_proxy filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.v3.GenericProxy>`. The
    ``%REQUEST_PROPERTY%`` and ``%RESPONSE_PROPERTY%`` specifiers can now be used in
    :ref:`value <envoy_v3_api_field_type.tracing.v3.CustomTag.value>` for generic proxy.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``drainConnectionUponCompletion()`` to the Lua filter stream info API, allowing Lua scripts to mark
    connections for draining (adds ``Connection: close`` for HTTP/1.1 or sends ``GOAWAY`` for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3).
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added an executions counter to the Lua filter to track script execution count.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Added ``sign`` foreign function to create cryptographic signatures. See :ref:`Wasm foreign functions
    <arch_overview_wasm_foreign_functions>` for details.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Moved the implementation of KEYS,SELECT,ROLE to the cluster scope command framework.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    The fixed heap resource monitor can calculate memory pressure as currently allocated memory divided by maximum heap
    size, providing more accurate and lower pressure values. This can avoid unnecessary load shedding. Enable via
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.fixed_heap_use_allocated``. The default algorithm (heap_size - pageheap_unmapped -
    pageheap_free) does not discount free memory in TCMalloc caches.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added :ref:`transport_socket_matcher
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.transport_socket_matcher>` to clusters. This matcher
    uses the generic xDS matcher framework to select a named transport socket from
    :ref:`transport_socket_matches
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.transport_socket_matches>` based on endpoint metadata,
    locality metadata, and transport socket filter state.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Added ``/memory/tcmalloc`` admin endpoint providing TCMalloc memory statistics.
- area: dns_filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`access_log <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3.DnsFilterConfig.access_log>` for the
    DNS filter.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added support for substitution formatting in rate limit descriptor values.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for ``redis_proxy`` to use separate credentials for each upstream Redis cluster.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for ``OBJECT``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added QUIC protocol option :ref:`max_sessions_per_event_loop
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.QuicProtocolOptions.max_sessions_per_event_loop>` to limit the maximum
    number of new QUIC sessions created per event loop. The default is 16, preserving the previous hardcoded limit.
- area: metrics_service
  change: |
    Added :ref:`batch_size <envoy_v3_api_field_config.metrics.v3.MetricsServiceConfig.batch_size>` to the Metrics
    Service to batch metrics into multiple gRPC messages. When positive, metrics are batched with at most ``batch_size``
    metric families per message to avoid gRPC size limits. If unset or 0, all metrics are sent in one message.
- area: network
  change: |
    Started populating filter state ``envoy.network.network_namespace`` when a connection is accepted on a listener with
    :ref:`network_namespace_filepath <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SocketAddress.network_namespace_filepath>`
    configured, providing read-only access to the network namespace for filters, access logs, and other components.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added configuration field
    :ref:`enforce_response_header_limits <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.enforce_response_header_limits>`
    to the HTTP ext_authz filter to enable or disable dropping response headers once header count or size limits are
    reached.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Added runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.report_load_when_rq_active_is_non_zero``. When enabled, LRS
    continues to send ``locality_stats`` reports to the config server even when no requests were issued in the poll
    cycle.
- area: on_demand
  change: |
    Added runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.on_demand_track_end_stream``. When enabled, the on_demand filter
    tracks downstream ``end_stream`` state to support stream recreation with fully read request bodies. Previously, the
    filter rejected all requests with bodies by checking only for a decoding buffer.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`request_mirror_policies <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.request_mirror_policies>`
    to :ref:`HttpProtocolOptions <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions>` for cluster-level
    request mirroring. Cluster-level policies override route-level policies when both are configured.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`retry_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.retry_policy>` to
    :ref:`HttpProtocolOptions <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions>` for cluster-level
    retry policies.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`hash_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.hash_policy>` to
    :ref:`HttpProtocolOptions <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions>` for cluster-level
    hash policies.
- area: network
  change: |
    Added logging info for network ext_proc to filter state.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added an extension to override the :ref:`upstream bind address Linux network namespace
    <extension_envoy.upstream.local_address_selector.filter_state_override>` using a shared filter state object.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added ``US_RX_BODY_BEG`` time point to ``%COMMON_DURATION%`` to indicate when upstream response body reception
    begins.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    The :ref:`MappedAttributeBuilder
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.ext_proc.processing_request_modifiers.mapped_attribute_builder.v3.MappedAttributeBuilder>`
    ext_proc extension now supports re-mapping response attributes (in addition to request attributes).
- area: router
  change: |
    Added substitution formatting for direct response bodies via
    :ref:`body_format <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.DirectResponseAction.body_format>` in
    :ref:`DirectResponseAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.DirectResponseAction>`.
- area: tls_inspector
  change: |
    Propagated transport errors from tls_inspector to ``DownstreamTransportFailureReason`` in ``StreamInfo`` for access logging
    prior to the TLS handshake.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Added support for MaxMind Country database via
    :ref:`country_db_path <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.geoip_providers.maxmind.v3.MaxMindConfig.country_db_path>`.
- area: tls_inspector
  change: |
    Added configuration parameter to TLS inspector for maximum acceptable client hello size.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Enhanced TLS certificate validation failure messages in access logs to include detailed error information.
    The ``%DOWNSTREAM_TRANSPORT_FAILURE_REASON%`` and ``%UPSTREAM_TRANSPORT_FAILURE_REASON%`` access log
    formatters now include specific validation failure reasons such as ``verify cert failed: SAN matcher``,
    ``verify cert failed: cert hash and spki``, or the OpenSSL verification error string (e.g., certificate
    has expired, unable to get local issuer certificate). This provides better visibility into TLS handshake
    failures without requiring debug-level logging.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added support for forwarding cluster metadata to ext_proc server.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Added ``match_included_headers`` to the request signing extension to allow positive header matching while excluding
    other non-SigV4-required headers.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Added :ref:`custom_header_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.geoip.v3.Geoip.custom_header_config>`
    to allow extracting the client IP address from a custom request header which can be used instead of
    ``x-forwarded-for`` header or downstream connection source address.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Added :ref:`client_ip <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.geoip.v3.Geoip.client_ip>`
    to the network geoip filter, enabling dynamic client IP extraction using format specifiers. This allows
    flexible extraction of client IP from filter state, dynamic metadata, or other sources for geolocation lookups.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`metadata_context_namespaces
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.metadata_context_namespaces>` and
    :ref:`typed_metadata_context_namespaces
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.typed_metadata_context_namespaces>` in the
    ext-authz network filter. This allows passing connection metadata (such as proxy protocol TLV data) to the
    external authorization server for making authorization decisions.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added support for fetching certificates on-demand via SDS in the downstream TLS transport socket
    using the extension :ref:`on-demand certificate selector
    <extension_envoy.tls.certificate_selectors.on_demand_secret>`.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Added :ref:`allow_paths <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Admin.allow_paths>` to admin
    interface to restrict access to specific admin endpoints. When configured, only paths matching
    the specified string matchers will be accessible. All other paths will return 403 Forbidden.
- area: attributes
  change: |
    Added :ref:`attributes <arch_overview_attributes>` for looking up request or response header bytes.
- area: json_to_metadata
  change: |
    Added support for per-route configuration override in the ``json_to_metadata`` http filter. Routes can now
    specify different JSON to metadata conversion rules via per-route configuration, allowing different routes
    to extract different metadata from request or response bodies.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Dynatrace sampler parses and propagates trace capture reason in tracestate.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added support for the ``REQUESTED_SERVER_NAME`` access log formatter to return SNI and host with parameters.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Added :ref:`tlv_location <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.listener.proxy_protocol.v3.ProxyProtocol.tlv_location>`
    configuration field to control where proxy protocol TLV values are stored. When set to ``FILTER_STATE``, TLV values
    are stored in a single filter state object with key ``envoy.network.proxy_protocol.tlv``, enabling HTTP filters to
    access TLV values via FilterStateInput without requiring custom HTTP filters to copy metadata. Individual TLV values
    can be accessed via field access: ``%FILTER_STATE(envoy.network.proxy_protocol.tlv:FIELD:key)%``. Defaults to
    ``DYNAMIC_METADATA`` to maintain existing behavior.
- area: mcp
  change: |
    Added :ref:`MCP filter <config_http_filters_mcp>` for parsing Model Context Protocol (MCP) JSON-RPC requests.
    The filter extracts the ``method`` and ``id`` fields from incoming requests and stores them in dynamic metadata
    for use by downstream filters and access logging. Notifications (methods starting with ``notifications/``) are
    correctly handled as they don't have an ``id`` field per the JSON-RPC specification.
- area: mcp
  change: |
    Added :ref:`mcp_router HTTP filter <config_http_filters_mcp_router>` which routes MCP (Model Context Protocol)
    requests to more backend servers. The filter supports fanout to multiple backends for initialize and tools-list requests,
    single-backend routing for tools-call based on tool name prefix, session management with composite session IDs,
    and response aggregation.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added ``LISTENER_FILTER_CHAIN`` to the ``METADATA`` command operator to allow access to listener filter chain metadata.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added per HTTP event processing effects in the ``ExtProcLoggingInfo`` filter state. This new data tracks
    the processing effects (mutation applied, rejected, etc.) for headers, body, and trailers and can be
    accessed via the ``processingEffects`` method.
- area: network
  change: |
    Fixed socket address proto translations to preserve network namespace filepath information.
    Previously, listeners in the non-default namespaces would lose this information when passed through
    proto translation, causing admin ``/listeners`` endpoint (and other consumers) to fail to display the namespace.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added support for additional parameters in the OAuth2 token request body via
    :ref:`endpoint_params <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.http.injected_credentials.oauth2.v3.OAuth2.endpoint_params>`.
    This allows passing custom parameters required by authorization servers (such as Logto or EntraID) that expect
    additional body parameters during the token exchange.
