- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in :ref:`preconnecting <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.PreconnectPolicy>` where established connection
    unused capacity was not considered in the logic to establish new connections, resulting in new connections anytime there was not
    a connection currently in the process of being established. This resulted in far too many connections being established, with the only
    bounds being cluster circuit breaker limits or upstream service limits.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Fixes a bug where local replies were incorrectly sent to the ext_proc server for external processing.
    This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy_reloadable_features_skip_ext_proc_on_local_reply``
    to ``false``.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixes an Envoy crash issue when a local reply is sent.
    This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy_reloadable_features_router_filter_resetall_on_local_reply`` to ``false``.
