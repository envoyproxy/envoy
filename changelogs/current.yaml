new_features:
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added support for request payloads in HTTP health checks. The ``send`` field in ``HttpHealthCheck`` can now be
    used to specify a request body to be sent during health checking. This feature supports both hex-encoded text
    and binary payloads, similar to TCP health checks. The payload can only be used with HTTP methods that support
    request bodies (POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS). Methods that must not have request bodies (GET, HEAD, DELETE, TRACE)
    are validated and will throw an error if combined with payloads. The implementation is optimized to process the
    payload once during configuration and reuse it for all health check requests. See :ref:`HttpHealthCheck
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck>` for configuration details.
- area: set_metadata
  change: |
    Added ``format_string`` support to the set_metadata filter. This allows dynamic placeholder expansion using Envoy's
    substitution formatter, enabling values like ``%VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_NAME%``, ``%REQ(header-name)%``, and other
    :ref:`format strings <config_access_log_format_strings>` to be expanded when setting metadata.
