- area: tls
  change: |
    Fixed an issue with incorrectly cached connection properties on TLS connections.
    If TLS connection data was queried before it was available, an empty value was being incorrectly cached, preventing later calls from
    getting the correct value. This could be triggered with a ``tcp_proxy`` access log configured to emit a log upon connection
    establishment if the log contains fields of the the TLS peer certificate. Then a later use of the data, such as the network RBAC
    filter validating a peer certificate SAN, may incorrectly fail due to the empty cached value.
- area: release
  change: |
    Container (Ubuntu/distroless) updates, and fixed permissions for distroless config directory.
