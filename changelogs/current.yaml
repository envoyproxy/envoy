behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: aws_iam
  change: |
    As announced in November 2024 (see https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/37621), the
    grpc_credentials/aws_iam extension is being deleted. Any configuration referencing this extension
    will fail to load.
- area: prefix_match_map
  change: |
    :ref:`prefix_match_map <envoy_v3_api_field_config.common.matcher.v3.Matcher.MatcherTree.prefix_match_map>`
    now continues to search for a match with shorter prefix if a longer match
    does not find an action. This brings it in line with the behavior of ``matcher_list``.
    This change can temporarily be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.prefix_map_matcher_resume_after_subtree_miss`` to false.
    If the old behavior is desired more permanently, this can be achieved in config by setting
    an ``on_no_match`` action that responds with 404 for each subtree.
- area: server
  change: |
    Envoy will automatically raise the soft limit on the file descriptors to the hard limit. This behavior
    can be reverted using the runtime guard ``envoy_restart_features_raise_file_limits``.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: lua
  change: |
    The ``metadata()`` of lua filter now will search the metadata by the :ref:`filter config name
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpFilter.name>` first.
    And if not found, it will search by the canonical name of the filter ``envoy.filters.http.lua``.
- area: grpc-json
  change: |
    Make the :ref:`gRPC JSON transcoder filter's <config_http_filters_grpc_json_reverse_transcoder>` json print options configurable.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Reset CSRF token when token validation fails during redirection.
    If the CSRF token cookie is present during the redirection to the authorization server, it will be validated.
    Previously, if this validation failed, the oauth flow would fail. Now the CSRF token will simply be reset. This fixes
    the case where an hmac secret change causes a redirect flow, but the CSRF token cookie hasn't yet expired
    causing a CSRF token validation failure.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Precompile regexes in cel expressions. This can be disabled by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_cel_regex_precompilation`` to false.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Allow getaddrinfo to be configured to run by a thread pool, controlled by :ref:`num_resolver_threads
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig.num_resolver_threads>`.
- area: grpc-json-transcoding
  change: |
    Add SSE style message framing for streamed responses in :ref:`gRPC JSON transcoder filter <config_http_filters_grpc_json_transcoder>`.
- area: http
  change: |
   :ref:`response_headers_to_add <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.response_headers_to_add>` and
   :ref:`response_headers_to_remove <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.response_headers_to_remove>`
   will also be applied to the local responses from the ``envoy.filters.http.router`` filter.
- area: aws
  change: |
    :ref:`AwsCredentialProvider <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.common.aws.v3.AwsCredentialProvider>` now supports all defined credential
    providers, allowing complete customisation of the credential provider chain when using AWS request signing extension.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: conn_pool
  change: |
    Fixed an issue that could lead to too many connections when using
    :ref:`AutoHttpConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.AutoHttpConfig>` if the
    established connection is ``http/2`` and Envoy predicted it would have lower concurrent capacity.
- area: conn_pool
  change: |
    Fixed an issue that could lead to insufficient connections for current pending requests. If a connection starts draining while it
    has negative unused capacity (which happens if an HTTP/2 ``SETTINGS`` frame reduces allowed concurrency to below the current number
    of requests), that connection's unused capacity will be included in total pool capacity even though it is unusable because it is
    draining. This can result in not enough connections being established for current pending requests. This is most problematic for
    long-lived requests (such as streaming gRPC requests or long-poll requests) because a connection could be in the draining state
    for a long time.
- area: hcm
  change: |
    Fixes a bug where the lifetime of the HttpConnectionManager's ActiveStream can be out of sync
    with the lifetime of the codec stream.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixes a bug in Envoy's HTTP/3-to-HTTP/1 proxying when a "transfer-encoding" header is incorrectly appended.
    Protected by runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_signal_headers_only_to_http1_backend``.

    for adding/removing trailers from the request and the response.

    Included the asterisk ``*`` in the match pattern when using the * or ** operators in the URL template.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uri_template_match_on_asterisk`` to ``false``.
- area: socket
  change: |

    ``openid`` is in the :ref:`auth_scopes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.auth_scopes>` field.
    If configured, the OAuth2 filter will redirect users to this endpoint when they access the
    :ref:`signout_path <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.signout_path>`. This allows users to
    be logged out of the Authorization server.
