    New implementation of the JSON formatter will be enabled by default.
    The :ref:`sort_properties <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.JsonFormatOptions.sort_properties>` field will
    be ignored in the new implementation because the new implementation always sorts properties. And the new implementation
    will always keep the value type in the JSON output. For example, the duration field will always be rendered as a number
    instead of a string.
    This behavior change could be disabled temporarily by setting the runtime
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.logging_with_fast_json_formatter`` to false.

    The NaN and Infinity values of float will be serialized to ``null`` and ``"inf"`` respectively in the
    metadata (``DYNAMIC_METADATA``, ``CLUSTER_METADATA``, etc.) formatter.

    Removed runtime flag ``envoy.restart_features.allow_client_socket_creation_failure`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added support for P-384 and P-521 curves for TLS server certificates.
- area: stats ads grpc
  change: |
    Fixed metric for ADS disconnection counters using Google GRPC client. This extracts the GRPC client prefix specified
    in the :ref:`Google GRPC <config.core.v3.GrpcService.GoogleGrpc>` resource used for ADS, and adds that as a tag 
    ``envoy_google_grpc_client_prefix`` to the Prometheus stats.
