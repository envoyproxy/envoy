behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: server
  change: |
    Added container-aware CPU detection on Linux that respects cgroup CPU limits in addition to hardware thread count
    and CPU affinity. This change only affects behavior when the ``--concurrency`` flag is not explicitly set.
    Envoy now uses the minimum of hardware threads, CPU affinity, and cgroup CPU limits
    to determine the number of worker threads by default. This provides better resource utilization in
    containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes) where CPU limits are set via cgroups. The new behavior
    is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the ``ENVOY_CGROUP_CPU_DETECTION`` environment
    variable to ``false``. When disabled, Envoy will fall back to the previous behavior of using only
    hardware thread count and CPU affinity for worker thread calculation. Uses conservative rounding (floor)
    to account for non-worker threads and prevent container throttling, which may reduce the total number of
    connections.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    The dynamic module ABI has been updated to support streaming body manipulation. This change also
    fixed potential incorrect behavior when access or modify the request or response body. See
    https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/40918 for more details.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`host_rewrite
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.host_rewrite>` to
    :ref:`RouteAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteAction>` to support substitution
    formatting for host header rewriting.
    Added :ref:`path_rewrite
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.path_rewrite>` to
    :ref:`RouteAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteAction>` to support substitution
    formatting for path header rewriting.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Closing the gRPC stream if Envoy detects no more external processing needed.
    This doesn't apply to BUFFERED and BUFFERED_PARTIAL mode and a few corner cases for now.
    For those cases, the stream will be closed during the filter destruction.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_proc_stream_close_optimization`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Check that the response header count is less than the configured limits before applying mutations, and do not
    add new headers if not.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed HTTP ext_authz service to properly propagate headers (such as ``set-cookie``) back to clients. The
    filter now correctly uses ``allowed_client_headers`` for denied responses and ``allowed_client_headers_on_success``
    for successful authorization responses.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Switch to use QUICHE provided migration logic to handle port migration upon path degrading and migration to Server
    Preferred Address. This behavior can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_migration_in_quiche``.
- area: mobile
  change: |
    Use mobile specific network observer registries to propagate network change signals. This behavior can be reverted by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.mobile_use_network_observer_registry``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: http2
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Envoy would leak memory if an HTTP/2 stream was reset before request headers were
    sent. For example, if an upstream HTTP filter sent a local reply after the connection was established but
    before request headers were sent, the memory allocated for the stream was not released.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Optimized HTTP/2 header processing by avoiding memory allocations and string copies for well-known header names.
    For common HTTP/2 headers (such as ``:method``, ``:path``, ``:status``, ``content-type``, ``user-agent``, etc.),
    Envoy now references static strings instead of copying header names. This reduces memory allocations and improves
    performance for typical HTTP/2 traffic.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Lua filters could cause Envoy to crash when setting the response body to a payload larger
    than the body buffer limit.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Add the missing conversion support to ensure tapped message are correctly handled for multi-event submissions.
- area: bootstrap
  change: |
    Fixed an issue where the custom
    :ref:`header_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.header_prefix>`
    would result in a crash at startup.
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fixed a crash in the TCP connection pool that occurs during downstream connection teardown when large requests
    or responses trigger flow control.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed ``shouldDrainConnectionUponCompletion()`` to properly send ``GOAWAY`` frames for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
    instead of aggressively closing connections. This prevents response body transmission interruption and
    ``ERR_DRAINING`` errors on the client side. HTTP/1.1 behavior remains unchanged.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a few areas where the addresses might be moved from the data packet being processed.
- area: composite
  change: |
    Fixed per-route configuration for composite filter to support matching on response headers and trailers.
    Previously, per-route matchers would silently fail when attempting to match on ``HttpResponseHeaderMatchInput``
    or ``HttpResponseTrailerMatchInput``, causing the delegated filter to be skipped without error.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed a regression where router-set headers (e.g., ``x-envoy-expected-rq-timeout-ms``, ``x-envoy-attempt-count``)
    were not accessible in ``request_headers_to_add`` configuration on the initial request. Headers configured via
    ``request_headers_to_add`` can now reference router-set headers using formatters like
    ``%REQ(x-envoy-expected-rq-timeout-ms)%``.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where attributes based on request headers (e.g. ``request.host``) were not sent to
    the ext_proc server if ext_proc was configured to only run on the encode path.

    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.tcp_proxy_retry_on_different_event_loop`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_balsa_allow_cr_or_lf_at_request_start`` and legacy code paths.
- area: quic
  change: |

- area: xds
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.report_load_with_rq_issued`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: http filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`transform http filter <config_http_filters_transform>` which adds the ability to modify request
    and response bodies in any position of HTTP filter chain.
    This also make it possible to refresh routes based on the attributes in the request body.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Support process-level rate limiting on access log emission by
    :ref:`ProcessRateLimitFilter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.access_loggers.filters.process_ratelimit.v3.ProcessRateLimitFilter>`.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Enhanced dynamic module ABIs to support headers addition and body size retrieval.
    See the latest ABI header file for more details.
- area: udp_sink
  change: |
    Enhanced the UDP sink to support tapped messages larger than 64 KB.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added a new :ref:`access logger <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.access_loggers.stats.v3.Config>` which emits
    configurable metrics.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Added support for dropping stats via
    :ref:`DropAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.stat_sinks.open_telemetry.v3.SinkConfig.DropAction>` during
    custom metric conversion.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`vhost_header <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteConfiguration.vhost_header>` to
    :ref:`RouteConfiguration <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteConfiguration>`, allowing use of a different
    header for vhost matching.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Added new parameter to the ``sendGoAwayAndClose`` to support gracefully closing of HTTP/2 connection.
- area: logging
  change: |
    Added support for the not-equal operator in access log filter rules, in
    :ref:`ComparisonFilter <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.accesslog.v3.ComparisonFilter>`.
- area: c-ares
  change: |
    Add an optional ``reinit_channel_on_timeout`` to the c-ares resolver to reinitialize the channel
    after DNS timeouts.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Added per-expression configuration options for CEL evaluator to control string conversion, concatenation,
    and string extension functions. CEL expressions in RBAC policies and access logger filters
    can now enable string functions such as ``replace()`` and ``split()`` through the new
    :ref:`cel_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.rbac.v3.Policy.cel_config>` and
    :ref:`cel_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.access_loggers.filters.cel.v3.ExpressionFilter.cel_config>` fields
    in their respective configurations. See :ref:`CelExpressionConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.CelExpressionConfig>`
    for details.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added support for the following new access log formatters:

    #. ``%REQUEST_HEADER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%REQ(X?Y):Z%``.
    #. ``%RESPONSE_HEADER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%RESP(X?Y):Z%``.
    #. ``%RESPONSE_TRAILER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%TRAILER(X?Y):Z%``.

    This provides a more consistent naming scheme for users to understand and use.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added new :ref:`value <envoy_v3_api_field_type.tracing.v3.CustomTag.value>` field and
    the :ref:`substitution format specifier <config_access_log_format>` could be used to
    extract values from various parts of the request/response for custom tags.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    Added custom substitution format specifiers support in the tracing custom tags of the
    :ref:`generic_proxy
    filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.v3.GenericProxy>`.
    Now the ``%REQUEST_PROPERTY%``, ``%RESPONSE_PROPERTY%`` etc. can be used in the
    :ref:`value <envoy_v3_api_field_type.tracing.v3.CustomTag.value>` field for generic proxy.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``drainConnectionUponCompletion()`` to the Lua filter stream info API. This allows Lua scripts
    to mark connections for draining, which adds a ``Connection: close`` header for HTTP/1.1 or sends a
    ``GOAWAY`` frame for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added new executions counter to the Lua filter to track script execution count.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Added ``sign`` foreign function to create cryptographic signatures.
    See :ref:`Wasm foreign functions <arch_overview_wasm_foreign_functions>` for more details.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added cluster-scoped command support with a flexible response handling framework.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    The fixed heap resource monitor can now calculate memory pressure as currently allocated memory divided by maximum heap size,
    giving more accurate and lower memory pressure values.
    This can avoid unnecessary load shedding or overload actions.
    To enable, set ``envoy.reloadable_features.fixed_heap_use_allocated`` to true.
    The default algorithm (heap_size - pageheap_unmapped - pageheap_free) does not discount for free memory in TCMalloc caches.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added :ref:`transport_socket_matcher
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.transport_socket_matcher>` to clusters. This matcher
    uses the generic xDS matcher framework to select a named transport socket from
    :ref:`transport_socket_matches
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.transport_socket_matches>` based on endpoint metadata,
    locality metadata, and transport socket filter state.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Added ``/memory/tcmalloc`` admin endpoint that provides TCMalloc memory statistics.
- area: dns_filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`access_log <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3.DnsFilterConfig.access_log>` for DNS filter.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added QUIC protocol option :ref:`max_sessions_per_event_loop
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.QuicProtocolOptions.max_sessions_per_event_loop>` to limit the maximum
    number of new QUIC sessions created per event loop. The default is 16, preserving the previous hardcoded limit.
- area: metrics_service
  change: |
    Added :ref:`batch_size <envoy_v3_api_field_config.metrics.v3.MetricsServiceConfig.batch_size>` configuration
    to the Metrics Service to allow batching metrics into multiple gRPC messages. When set to a positive value,
    metrics will be batched with at most ``batch_size`` metric families per message. This helps avoid hitting
    gRPC message size limits (typically 4MB) when sending large numbers of metrics. If not set or set to 0,
    all metrics will be sent in a single message, preserving the current behavior.
- area: network
  change: |
    Added a change to start populating the filter state ``envoy.network.network_namespace`` when a connection is accepted on a
    listener with :ref:`network_namespace_filepath <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SocketAddress.network_namespace_filepath>`
    configured. This provides read-only access to the network namespace for filters, access logs, and other components.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Add a new configuration field to the http ext authz filter
    :ref:`enforce_response_header_limits <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.enforce_response_header_limits>`
    that allows admins to enable / disable the behavior of dropping response headers once the header
    map count / size constraints have been reached.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Added runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.report_load_when_rq_active_is_non_zero``.
    When enabled, LRS continues to send locality_stats reoprt to config server when there is no request_issued in the poll cycle.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`request_mirror_policies <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.request_mirror_policies>`
    to :ref:`HttpProtocolOptions <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions>` to support
    cluster-level request mirroring. Cluster-level policies override route-level policies when both are configured.
- area: network
  change: |
    Add logging info for network ext_proc to filter state.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added new ``US_RX_BODY_BEG`` time point to the ``%COMMON_DURATION%`` to indicate
    the time point of upstream response body receiving begin.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added support for substitution formatting in direct response bodies via the new
    :ref:`body_format <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.DirectResponseAction.body_format>` field
    in :ref:`DirectResponseAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.DirectResponseAction>`.
