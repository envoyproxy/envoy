- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.

new_features:
- area: router
  change: |
    Added runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.vhds_case_insensitive_match`` to control case sensitivity
    for host header matching in :ref:`VHDS (Virtual Host Discovery Service) <config_http_conn_man_vhds>`.
    When enabled (default is ``true``), host headers are converted to lowercase for matching, maintaining backward
    compatibility with previous behavior. Set to ``false`` to enable case-sensitive host header matching.
