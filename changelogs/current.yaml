behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Removed support for (long deprecated) opencensus tracing extension.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    The route cache will not be cleared by default if the wasm extension modified the request headers and
    the ABI version of wasm extension is larger then 0.2.1.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Remove previously deprecated xDS attributes from ``get_property``, use ``xds`` attributes instead.
- area: http
  change: |
    RFC1918 addresses are no longer considered to be internal addresses by default. This addresses a security
    issue for Envoy's in multi-tenant mesh environments. Please explicit set
    :ref:`internal_address_config
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.internal_address_config>`
    to retain the prior behavior.
    This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added streaming shadow functionality. This allows for streaming the shadow request in parallel with the original request
    rather than waiting for the original request to complete. This allows shadowing requests larger than the buffer limit,
    but also means shadowing may take place for requests which are canceled mid-stream. This behavior change can be
    temporarily reverted by flipping  ``envoy.reloadable_features.streaming_shadow`` to false.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: access_log
  change: |
    New implementation of the JSON formatter will be enabled by default.
    The :ref:`sort_properties <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.JsonFormatOptions.sort_properties>` field will
    be ignored in the new implementation because the new implementation always sorts properties. And the new implementation
    will always keep the value type in the JSON output. For example, the duration field will always be rendered as a number
    instead of a string.
    This behavior change could be disabled temporarily by setting the runtime
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.logging_with_fast_json_formatter`` to false.
- area: xds
  change: |
    A minor delta-xDS optimization that avoids copying resources when ingesting them was introduced.
    No impact to the behavior is expected, but a runtime flag was added as this may impact config-ingestion
    related extensions (e.g., custom-config-validators, config-tracker), as the order of the elements passed
    to the callback functions may be different. This change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.xds_prevent_resource_copy`` to ``false``.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    The NaN and Infinity values of float will be serialized to ``null`` and ``"inf"`` respectively in the
    metadata (``DYNAMIC_METADATA``, ``CLUSTER_METADATA``, etc.) formatter.
- area: sds
  change: |
    Relaxed the backing cluster validation for Secret Discovery Service(SDS). Currently, the cluster that supports SDS,
    needs to be a primary cluster i.e. a non-EDS cluster defined in bootstrap configuration. This change relaxes that
    restriction i.e. SDS cluster can be a dynamic cluster. This change is enabled by default, and can be reverted by setting
    the runtime flag ``envoy.restart_features.skip_backing_cluster_check_for_sds`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    If the :ref:`pack_trace_reason <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.request_id.uuid.v3.UuidRequestIdConfig.pack_trace_reason>`
    is set to false, Envoy will not parse the trace reason from the ``x-request-id`` header to ensure reads and writes of
    trace reason be consistant.
    If the :ref:`pack_trace_reason <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.request_id.uuid.v3.UuidRequestIdConfig.pack_trace_reason>`
    is set to true and external ``x-request-id`` value is used, the trace reason in the external request id will not
    be trusted and will be cleared.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    :ref:`use_refresh_token <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.use_refresh_token>`
    is now enabled by default. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth2_use_refresh_token`` to false.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    The ``state`` parameter in the OAuth2 authorization request has been changed to a base64url-encoded JSON object.
    The JSON object contains the original request URL and a nonce for CSRF prevention.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Enable UDP GRO in QUIC client connections by default. This behavior can be reverted by setting
    the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.prefer_quic_client_udp_gro`` to false.
- area: scoped_rds
  change: |
    The :ref:`route_configuration <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.ScopedRouteConfiguration.route_configuration>` field
    is supported when the ``ScopedRouteConfiguration`` resource is delivered via SRDS.
- area: http
  change: |
    Local replies now traverse the filter chain if 1xx headers have been sent to the client. This change can be reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.local_reply_traverses_filter_chain_after_1xx`` to false.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Patched c-ares to address CVE-2024-25629.
- area: csrf
  change: |
    Increase only the statistics counter ``missing_source_origin`` for requests with a missing source origin.
    Previously, the ``request_invalid`` counter was also increased for such requests.
- area: rate_limit
  change: |
    add ``WEEK`` to the unit of time for rate limit.
- area: rds
  change: |
    When a new RDS provider config is pushed via xDS and the only difference is change to
    :ref:`initial_fetch_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.initial_fetch_timeout>`,
    the already existing provider will be reused. Envoy will not ask RDS server for routes
    config because existing provider already has up to date routes config.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.normalize_rds_provider_config`` to false.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: lrs
  change: |
    Fixes errors stat being incremented and warning log spamming for LoadStatsReporting graceful stream close.
- area: tls

  change: |
    Fixes scope key leak and spurious scope key conflicts when an update to an SRDS resource changes the key.
- area: stats ads grpc
  change: |
    Fixed metric for ADS disconnection counters using Google GRPC client. This extracts the GRPC client prefix specified
    in the :ref:`google_grpc <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.GrpcService.google_grpc>` resource used for ADS, and adds
    that as a tag ``envoy_google_grpc_client_prefix`` to the Prometheus stats.
- area: golang
  change:
    Fixes a crash during Golang GC caused by accessing deleted decoder_callbacks. The bug was introduced in 1.31.0.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Relaxed the restriction on SNI logging to allow the ``_`` character, even if
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_sni_in_access_log`` is enabled.

  change: |
    Fixed an issue where ID token and refresh token did not adhere to the :ref:`cookie_domain
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Credentials.cookie_domain>` field.
- area: original_ip_detection custom header extension
  change: |
    Reverted :ref:`custom header
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.original_ip_detection.custom_header.v3.CustomHeaderConfig>` extension to its
    original behavior by disabling automatic XFF header appending that was inadvertently introduced in PR #31831.
- area: tracers
  change: |
    Avoid possible overflow when setting span attributes in Dynatrace sampler.
- area: load_balancing
  change: |
    Fixed default host weight calculation of :ref:`client_side_weighted_round_robin
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.client_side_weighted_round_robin.v3.ClientSideWeightedRoundRobin>`
    to properly handle even number of valid host weights.
- area: validation/tools
  change: |
    Add back missing extension for ``schema_validator_tool``.
- area: udp/dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed bug where dynamic_forward_proxy udp session filter disabled buffer in filter config
    instead of disabling buffer for the filter instance.
- area: csrf
  change: |
    Handle requests that have a "privacy sensitive" / opaque origin (``Origin: null``) as if the request had no origin information.

    Added support for logging upstream connection establishment duration in the
    :ref:`%COMMON_DURATION% <config_access_log_format_common_duration>` access log
    formatter operator. The following time points were added: ``%US_CX_BEG%``,
    ``%US_CX_END%``, ``%US_HS_END%``.

    Add logging functions to all lua objects. Previously these were only available on the Lua http filter request handle.
- area: access log
  change: |
    Added fields for :ref:`DOWNSTREAM_DIRECT_LOCAL_ADDRESS and DOWNSTREAM_DIRECT_LOCAL_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT <config_access_log_format>`.
- area: quic
  change: |

    Added support for scaling :ref:`max connection duration
    <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_config.overload.v3.ScaleTimersOverloadActionConfig.TimerType.HTTP_DOWNSTREAM_CONNECTION_MAX>`.
    This can be used to reduce the max connection duration in response to overload.
- area: tracers
  change: |
    Set resource ``telemetry.sdk.*`` and scope ``otel.scope.name|version`` attributes for the OpenTelemetry tracer.
- area: lua
  change: |

- area: lua cluster specifier
  change: |
    Added ability for a Lua script to query clusters for current requests and connections.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added :ref:`downstreamDirectLocalAddress() <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_downstream_direct_local_address>`
    method to the Stream info object API.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support for dynamic cluster selection in UDP proxy. The cluster can be set by one of the session filters
    by setting a per-session state object under the key ``envoy.udp_proxy.cluster``.
- area: filters
  change: |
    Added :ref:`the Api Key Auth filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.api_key_auth.v3.ApiKeyAuth>`, which
    can be used to authenticate requests using an API key.
- area: CEL-attributes
  change: |
    Added :ref:`attribute <arch_overview_attributes>` ``upstream.request_attempt_count``
    to get the number of times a request is attempted upstream.
- area: ip-tagging
  change: |
    Adds support for specifying an alternate header
    :ref:`ip_tag_header <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ip_tagging.v3.IPTagging.ip_tag_header>`
    for appending IP tags via ip-tagging filter instead of using the default header ``x-envoy-ip-tags``.
- area: c-ares
  change: |
    added two new options to c-ares resolver for configuring custom timeouts and tries while resolving DNS
    queries. Custom timeouts could be configured by specifying :ref:`query_timeout_seconds
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.cares.v3.CaresDnsResolverConfig.query_timeout_seconds>` and
    custom tries could be configured by specifying :ref:`query_tries
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.cares.v3.CaresDnsResolverConfig.query_tries>`.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    added :ref:`sourced_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.rbac.v3.Permission.sourced_metadata>` which allows
    specifying an optional source for the metadata to be matched in addition to the metadata matcher.
- area: c-ares
  change: |
    added nameserver rotation option to c-ares resolver. When enabled via :ref:rotate_nameservers
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.cares.v3.CaresDnsResolverConfig.rotate_nameservers>, this
    performs round-robin selection of the configured nameservers for each resolution to help distribute query load.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`%UPSTREAM_HOST_NAME_WITHOUT_PORT% <config_access_log_format_upstream_host_name_without_port>`
    for the upstream host identifier without the port value.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support for coexistence of dynamic and static clusters in the same udp proxy, so we can use dynamic clusters
    for some sessions by setting a per-session state object under the key ``envoy.upstream.dynamic_host`` and routing
    to dynamic cluster, and we can use static clusters for other sessions by setting a per-session state object under
    the key ``envoy.udp_proxy.cluster`` without setting ``envoy.upstream.dynamic_host``.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    added filter state field latency_us, bytesSent and bytesReceived access for CEL and logging.
- area: sni_dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    Added support in SNI dynamic forward proxy for saving the resolved upstream address in the filter state.
    The state is saved with the key ``envoy.stream.upstream_address``.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``setUpstreamOverrideHost()`` which could be used to set the given host as the upstream host for the
    current request.
- area: CEL-attributes
  change: |
    Added :ref:`attribute <arch_overview_attributes>` ``upstream.cx_pool_ready_duration``
    to get the duration from when the upstream request was created to when the upstream connection pool is ready.
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added new health check filter stats including total requests, successful/failed checks, cached responses, and
    cluster health status counters. These stats help track health check behavior and cluster health state.
- area: filters
  change: |
    Updatd the ``set_filter_state`` :ref:`filter <config_http_filters_set_filter_state>` to support per-route overrides.
- area: grpc-json
  change: |
    Added a new http filter for :ref:`gRPC to JSON transcoding <config_http_filters_grpc_json_reverse_transcoder>`.
- area: attributes
  change: |
    added new ``xds.virtual_host_name`` and ``xds.virtual_host_metadata`` attributes support. See
    :ref:`attributes <arch_overview_attributes>` for looking up xDS configuration information.

deprecated:
- area: rbac
  change: |
    metadata :ref:`metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.rbac.v3.Permission.metadata>` is now deprecated in the
    favor of :ref:`sourced_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_config.rbac.v3.Permission.sourced_metadata>`.
- area: aws_iam
  change: |
    The :ref:`aws_iam extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.grpc_credential.v3.AwsIamConfig>` is deprecated and will be
    deleted from Envoy in a future release, no later than Envoy 1.35, but possibly sooner.
