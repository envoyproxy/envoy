behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: jwt
  change: |
    Changed behavior of the JWT extraction, passing entire token for validation, instead cut him in the non-Base64 character.
    This change can be reverted temporarily by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.token_passed_entirely`` to ``false``.
- area: eds
  change: |
    Introduced caching of EDS assignments when used with ADS. Prior to this change, Envoy required that EDS assignments were sent
    after an EDS cluster was updated. If no EDS assignment was received for the cluster, it ended up with an empty assignment.
    Following this change, after a cluster update, Envoy waits for an EDS assignment until
    :ref:`initial_fetch_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.initial_fetch_timeout>` times out, and will then apply
    the cached assignment and finish updating the warmed cluster. This change is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting
    the runtime flag ``envoy.restart_features.use_eds_cache_for_ads`` to ``true``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Introduced a new runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_downgrade_to_canonical_name`` to disable the name downgrading in the
    per filter config searching.
    See doc :ref:`Http filter route specific config <arch_overview_http_filters_per_filter_config>` or
    issue https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/29461 for more specific detail and examples.
- area: http
  change: |
    Switch from http_parser to BalsaParser for handling HTTP/1.1 traffic. See https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/21245 for
    details. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_use_balsa_parser`` to
    ``false``.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    When the UDP proxy has session filters, choosing the upstream host and creating a socket only happens after iterating all
    ``onNewSession()`` calls for all the filters in the chain. Upstream host health check for each downstream datagram does
    not apply when there are session filters, and per-packet load balancing can't be used when there are session filters.
- area: zone-aware routing
  change: |
    Zone-aware routing is now enabled even when the originating and upstream cluster have different numbers of zones.
    Previously, zone-aware routing was disabled in that case and the ``lb_zone_number_differs`` stat on the cluster was incremented.
    This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_zone_routing_different_zone_counts`` to ``false``.
    Additionally, zone-aware routing now works correctly even when the originating and upstream cluster have different zone sets.
    Previously, zone-aware routing would not route fairly in this case.
    To revert the entire change, set the runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.locality_routing_use_new_routing_logic``
    to ``false`` to get the old behavior and well-tested codepaths, undoing both changes.

- area: UHV
  change: |
    Introduced runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_universal_header_validator`` for toggling Universal Header Validator
    (UHV) on and off.
    The default value is off. This option is currently functional only when the ``ENVOY_ENABLE_UHV`` build flag is enabled.
    See https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/10646 for more information about UHV.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Removing any query parameter in the presence of repeated query parameter keys no longer drops the repeats.
- area: alternate_protocols_cache_filter
  change: |
    Changed the alternate protocols cache filter to get the cache from cluster config rather than filter config.
    This allows one downstream filter to be used with multiple clusters with different caches. This change can be reverted by
    setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_cluster_cache_for_alt_protocols_filter`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Don't append the local address to ``x-forwarded-for`` header when sending an http (not gRPC) auth request.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_authz_http_send_original_xff`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Envoy will only take
    :ref:`mode_override <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse.mode_override>`
    when waiting for the header responses. It will be ignored if it is in other processing states.
- area: outlier detection
  change: |
    Outlier detection will always respect ``max_ejection_percent`` now.
    This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.check_mep_on_first_eject`` to ``false``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Enable QUICHE request and response headers validation. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.FLAGS_envoy_quic_reloadable_flag_quic_act_upon_invalid_header`` to ``false``.
- area: http oauth2 filter
  change: |
    Change HMAC cookie encoding to base64-encoded only. This change can be reverted temporarily by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.hmac_base64_encoding_only`` to ``false``.
- area: router
  change: |
    Enable copying response_code from the upstream stream_info onto the downstream stream_info.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.copy_response_code_to_downstream_stream_info`` to ``false``.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Set the lower bound of :ref:`fill_rate <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.RateLimitSettings.fill_rate>`
    to once per year. Values lower than once per year will automatically be set to that value.
- area: redis
  change: |
    The redis network filter :ref:`connection_rate_limit_per_sec
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.ConnectionRateLimit.connection_rate_limit_per_sec>`
    must be greater than 0. A config that sets this value to 0 will be rejected.
- area: http
  change: |
    Change the proxy status for ``UpstreamRequestTimeout`` to ``HttpResponseTimeout``.
    It can be disabled by the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.proxy_status_upstream_request_timeout``.
- area: local_rate_limit
  change: |
    Added new configuration field :ref:`always_consume_default_token_bucket
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.local_ratelimit.v3.LocalRateLimit.always_consume_default_token_bucket>`
    to allow for setting if default token bucket should be always consumed or only be consumed when there is no matching descriptor.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: connection limit
  change: |
    Fixed a use-after-free bug in the connection limit filter.
- area: subset load balancer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where
    :ref:`overprovisioning_factor<envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment.Policy.overprovisioning_factor>` and
    :ref:`weighted_priority_health <envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment.Policy.weighted_priority_health>`
    values were not respected when subset load balacing was enabled. The default values of ``140`` and ``false`` were always used.
- area: http1
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where HTTP/1.1 requests with ``Connection: close`` header is handled differently if the requested is internally redirected.
    Without internal redirect, the response will also have a ``Connection: close`` header and the connection will be closed after finishing
    that request. Requests with internal redirect should be handled in the same way. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_connection_close_header_in_redirect`` to ``false``.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where redis key formatter is using the closed stream because of life time issues.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    Fixed a bug causing crash if ECDS is used with upstream HTTP filters.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where handshake may fail when both private key provider and cert validation are set.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where when ``respect_dns_ttl`` was set to ``true``, c-ares dns resolver only considered address record for TTL calculation
    while ignoring CNAME records TTL. Now when ``respect_dns_ttl`` is set to ``true`` minimum of all TTL records is considered.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where dns response was not always conforming `RFC 2181 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181>`_ for TTL values.
    Previously a malicious user could add a TTL greater than 2^31 - 1, and with c-ares library using 32 bit signed int data type
    would overflow and send a negative TTL.
- area: healthcheck
  change: |
    The default behavior of unejecting outlier-detection-ejected host on successful active health checking can
    be disabled by setting :ref:`outlier_detection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.OutlierDetection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host>`
    to ``false``. This new configuration flag is a substitute for the removed runtime option
    ``envoy.reloadable_features_successful_active_health_check_uneject_host``.
- area: aws signer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where expiration timestamp on task roles failed to validate. This causes failure of credential caching which
    results in constant hits to the task role metadata URL.
- area: router check tool
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the route coverage is not correctly calculated when a route has weighted clusters.
- area: unix domain sockets
  change: |
    Fixed a crash on some versions of macOS when using a listener on a unix-domain socket.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where redis key with ``%`` in the key is failing with a validation error.

    outlier detection configuration flag.

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added ``%RESPONSE_FLAGS_LONG%`` substitution string, that will output a pascal case string representing the resonse flags.
    The output response flags will correspond with ``%RESPONSE_FLAGS%1``, only with a long textual string representation.
- area: config
  change: |
    Added the capability to defer broadcasting of certain cluster (CDS, EDS) to
    worker threads from the main thread. This optimization can save significant
    amount of memory in cases where there are (1) a large number of workers and
    (2) a large amount of config, most of which is unused. This capability is
    guarded by :ref:`enable_deferred_cluster_creation
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.ClusterManager.enable_deferred_cluster_creation>`.

    message from the external processing server.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added a field lookup to ``%FILTER_STATE%`` for objects that have reflection enabled.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`Json-To-Metadata filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.json_to_metadata.v3.JsonToMetadata>`.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Added possibility to track global downstream connection limit via :ref:`downstream connections monitor
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>` in overload manager.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    Added metric ``listener.listener_stat.network_extension_config_missing`` to track closed connections due to missing config.
- area: lua
  change: |
    added :ref:`downstreamRemoteAddress() <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_downstream_remote_address>`
    method to the Stream info object API.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added support for QUIC listener filters with ECDS support reusing the same config API
    :ref:`listener_filters <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.listener_filters>` as TCP does.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added :ref:`use_refresh_token <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.use_refresh_token>`
    to support updating an access token via a refresh token if that is provided by authorization server.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for ``time`` command (returns a local response).
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    Added ECDS support for :ref:`upstream network filters <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Filter.config_discovery>`.
- area: redis

    Added support for ``lmove`` command.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added :ref:`allow_redundant_keys <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.load_balancing_policies.subset.v3.Subset.allow_redundant_keys>`
    to suppport redundant keys in request metadata for subset load balancing.
- area: access_logs
  change: |
    Added :ref:`json_format_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SubstitutionFormatString.json_format_options>` config option to
    support JSON output formatting and the :ref:`sort_properties <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.JsonFormatOptions.sort_properties>`
    option to print the JSON output with sorted properties.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added :ref:`custom_sink <envoy_v3_api_field_config.tap.v3.OutputSink.custom_sink>` type to enable writing tap data
    out to a custom sink extension.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added :ref:`disable_stateful_session_resumption
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.DownstreamTlsContext.disable_stateful_session_resumption>` config option to
    disable stateful TLS session resumption.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Added :ref:`session_filters <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.udp_proxy.v3.UdpProxyConfig.session_filters>` config to
    support optional filters that will run for each upstream UDP session. More information can be found in the UDP proxy documentation.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Added ``injectDatagramToFilterChain()`` callback to UDP session filters that allows session filters to inject datagrams downstream
    or upstream the filter chain during a filter chain iteration. This can be used, for example, by session filters that are required
    to buffer datagrams due to an asynchronous call.
- area: otlp_stats_sink
  change: |
    Added :ref:`stats prefix option <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.stat_sinks.open_telemetry.v3.SinkConfig.prefix>`
    to OTLP stats sink that enables adding a static prefix to all stats flushed by this sink.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Added :ref:`http_capsule <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.udp.udp_proxy.session.http_capsule.v3.FilterConfig>` UDP session filter
    that can be used to encapsule or decapsulate UDP datagrams in HTTP, when used for UDP tunneling.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added :ref:`record_headers_received_time <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.tap.v3.Tap.record_headers_received_time>`
    to control writing request and response headers received time in trace output.
- area: zookeeper
  change: |
    Added support for emitting per opcode request bytes metrics via :ref:`enable_per_opcode_request_bytes_metrics
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.zookeeper_proxy.v3.ZooKeeperProxy.enable_per_opcode_request_bytes_metrics>`.
    added support for emitting per opcode response bytes metrics via :ref:`enable_per_opcode_response_bytes_metrics
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.zookeeper_proxy.v3.ZooKeeperProxy.enable_per_opcode_response_bytes_metrics>`.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added fallback :ref:`fallback
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.PrivateKeyProvider.fallback>`
    to support private key provider to fallback to boringssl TLS handshake.
    If the private key provider isn't available (eg. the required hardware capability doesn't existed),
    Envoy will fallback to the BoringSSL default implementation when the fallback is ``true``.
    The default value is ``false``.
- area: tcp
  change: |
    Added the support to detect and send TCP RST for raw buffer socket based connections. This is currently supported on Linux only.
    It can be disabled by the runtime guard ``envoy_reloadable_features_detect_and_raise_rst_tcp_connection``.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added the ability to specify a custom upstream local address selector using
    :ref:`local_address_selector:<envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.local_address_selector>`.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added new configuration field :ref:`read_command_policy
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.PrefixRoutes.Route.read_command_policy>`
    to specify Envoy should route read commands to another cluster.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added :ref:`record_downstream_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.tap.v3.Tap.record_downstream_connection>`
    to control writing downstream connection address info in trace output.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added :ref:`spawn_upstream_span
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.spawn_upstream_span>`
    to control whether to create separate upstream span for upstream request.
- area: original_dst
  change: |
    Added support for the internal listener address recovery using the original destination listener filter.
