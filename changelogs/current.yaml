- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.

# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fix a crash in the TCP connection pool that occurs during downstream connection teardown when large requests
    or responses trigger flow control.
