behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: server
  change: |
    Added container-aware CPU detection on Linux that respects cgroup CPU limits in addition to hardware thread count
    and CPU affinity. This change only affects behavior when the ``--concurrency`` flag is not explicitly set.
    Envoy now uses the minimum of hardware threads, CPU affinity, and cgroup CPU limits
    to determine the number of worker threads by default. This provides better resource utilization in
    containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes) where CPU limits are set via cgroups. The new behavior
    is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the ``ENVOY_CGROUP_CPU_DETECTION`` environment
    variable to ``false``. When disabled, Envoy will fall back to the previous behavior of using only
    hardware thread count and CPU affinity for worker thread calculation. Uses conservative rounding (floor)
    to account for non-worker threads and prevent container throttling. This can cause potential total connections
    number drop.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`host_rewrite
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.host_rewrite>` to
    :ref:`RouteAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteAction>` to support substitution
    formatting for host header rewriting.
    Added :ref:`path_rewrite
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.path_rewrite>` to
    :ref:`RouteAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteAction>` to support substitution
    formatting for path header rewriting.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Check the response header count is < the configured limits before applying mutations and don't
    add new headers if not.
- area: mobile
  change: |
    Use mobile specific network observer registries to propagate network change signals. This behavior can be reverted by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.mobile_use_network_observer_registry``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: http2
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Envoy will leak memory if the HTTP2 stream is reset before the request headers are
    sent. For example, if one upstream http filter send a local reply after the connection is established but
    before the request headers are sent, the memory allocated for the stream will not be released.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Fix a bug where Lua filters may result in Envoy crashes when setting response body to a
    larger payload (greater than the body buffer limit).
- area: bootstrap
  change: |
    Fixed an issue where the custom
    :ref:`header_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.header_prefix>`
    will result in crash at startup.
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fix a crash in the TCP connection pool that occurs during downstream connection teardown when large requests
    or responses trigger flow control.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed ``shouldDrainConnectionUponCompletion()`` to properly send ``GOAWAY`` frames for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
    instead of aggressively closing connections. This prevents response body transmission interruption and
    ``ERR_DRAINING`` errors on the client side. HTTP/1.1 behavior remains unchanged.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.jwt_fetcher_use_scheme_from_uri`` and legacy code paths.
- area: tcp
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.tcp_proxy_retry_on_different_event_loop`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_balsa_allow_cr_or_lf_at_request_start`` and legacy code paths.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http3_remove_empty_cookie`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.original_src_fix_port_exhaustion`` and legacy code paths.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.report_load_with_rq_issued`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: http
  change: |
    Added ``vhost_header`` to the RouteConfiguration, allowing use of a different header for vhost matching.
- area: logging
  change: |
    Added support for not-equal operator for access log filter rules, in
    :ref:`ComparisonFilter <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.accesslog.v3.ComparisonFilter>`.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``drainConnectionUponCompletion()`` to the Lua filter stream info API. This allows Lua scripts
    to mark connections for draining, which adds a ``Connection: close`` header for HTTP/1.1 or sends a
    ``GOAWAY`` frame for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Added ``sign`` foreign function to create cryptographic signatures.
    See :ref:`Wasm foreign functions <arch_overview_wasm_foreign_functions>` for more details.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added cluster-scope command support with flexible response handling framework.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    The fixed heap resource monitor can now calculate memory pressure as currently allocated memory divided by maximum heap size,
    giving more accurate and lower memory pressure values.
    This can avoid unnecessary load shedding or overload actions.
    To enable, set ``envoy.reloadable_features.fixed_heap_use_allocated`` to true.
    The default algorithm (heap_size - pageheap_unmapped - pageheap_free) does not discount for free memory in TCMalloc caches.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Added ``/memory/tcmalloc`` admin endpoint that provides TCMalloc memory statistics.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Add a new quic configuration field, 'max_sessions_per_event_loop', to QuicProtocolOptions in Envoy listener.
    This allows tuning the maximum number of new QUIC sessions created within a single event loop.
    The default value is 16, preserving the previous hardcoded limit.
