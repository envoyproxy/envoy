- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.

new_features:
- area: router
  change: |
    Added runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.vhds_case_sensitive_query`` to control case sensitivity for VHDS
    (Virtual Host Discovery Service) queries. When enabled (default is ``true``), VHDS queries use the original
    case-sensitive host header value. When disabled, host headers are lowercased before VHDS query for backwards
    compatibility. Note: Domain matching is always case-insensitive regardless of this flag.
    See :ref:`VHDS <config_http_conn_man_vhds>` for more details.
