behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: thread_local
  change: |
    Changes the behavior of the ``SlotImpl`` class destructor. With this change the destructor can be called on any thread.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_slot_destroy_on_worker_threads``
    to false.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: tracers
  change: |
    Set status code for OpenTelemetry tracers (previously unset).
- area: xds
  change: |
    Updated xDS-TP path naming to better comply with RFC-3986. Encoded resource paths can now include an a colon ``:``,
    instead of ``%3A``. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.xdstp_path_avoid_colon_encoding`` to ``false``.
- area: udp
  change: |
    Change GRO read buffer to 64kB to avoid MSG_TRUNC. And change the way to limit the number of packets processed per event
    loop to work with GRO. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.udp_socket_apply_aggregated_read_limit`` to false.
- area: statistics
  change: |
    Hot restart statistics like hot_restart_epoch are only set when hot restart is enabled.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: outlier detection
  change: |
    Fixed :ref:`successful_active_health_check_uneject_host
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.OutlierDetection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host>`.
    Before, a failed health check could uneject the host if the ``FAILED_ACTIVE_HC`` health flag had not been set.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix a RELEASE_ASSERT when using :ref:`auto_sni <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.UpstreamHttpProtocolOptions.auto_sni>`
    if the downstream request ``:authority`` was longer than 255 characters.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fix a crash when reloading the HTTP Connection Manager via ECDS.
- area: cares
  change: |
    Upgraded c-ares library to 1.20.1 and added fix to c-ares DNS implementation to additionally check for ``ARES_EREFUSED``,
    ``ARES_ESERVFAIL``and ``ARES_ENOTIMP`` status. Without this fix, ``DestroyChannelOnRefused`` and
    ``CustomResolverValidAfterChannelDestruction`` unit test will break.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Handle ``append_action`` from :ref:`external authorization service <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.auth.v3.CheckResponse>`
    that was ignored.
