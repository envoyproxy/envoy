behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: build
  change: |
    Moved the subset, ring_hash, and maglev LB code into extensions. If you use these load balancers and override
    extensions_build_config.bzl you will need to include them explicitly.
- area: build
  change: |
    Moved xDS code extensions. If you use the xDS and override extensions_build_config.bzl you will
    need to include the new config_subscriptions explicitly.
- area: http
  change: |
    When ``append_x_forwarded_host`` is enabled for a given route action it is now only appended iff it is different from the last
    value in the list. This resolves issues where a retry caused the same value to be appended multiple times. This
    behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy_reloadable_features_append_xfh_idempotent`` to false.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Increase granularity mapping connection pool failures to specific stream failure reasons to make it more transparent why
    the stream is reset when a connection pool's connection fails.
- area: custom response
  change: |
    The filter now traverses matchers from most specific to least specific per filter config till a match is found for the response.
- area: http1
  change: |
    Allowing mixed case schemes in absolute urls (e.g. HtTp://www.google.com). Mixed case schemes will be normalized to
    the lower cased equivalents before being forwarded upstream. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_absolute_url_with_mixed_scheme`` to false.
- area: http1
  change: |
    The HTTP1 server-side codec no longer considers encoding 1xx headers as
    starting the response. This allows the codec to raise protocol errors,
    sending detailed local replies instead of just closing the connection. This
    behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_allow_codec_error_response_after_1xx_headers``
    to false.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Changing the DNS cache to use host:port as the cache key rather than host. This allows a
    downstream DFP filter to serve both secure and insecure clusters. This behavioral change
    can be reverted by setting runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_mixed_scheme`` to false.
- area: uhv
  change: |
    Preserve case of %-encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_preserve_url_encoded_case`` to false, in which case %-encoded triplets are normalized
    to uppercase characters. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.
- area: uhv
  change: |
    Allow malformed URL encoded triplets in the default header validator. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_allow_malformed_url_encoding`` to false, in which case requests with malformed URL encoded triplets
    in path are rejected. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect otherwise.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    When :ref:`clear_route_cache <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ext_proc.v3.CommonResponse.clear_route_cache>` is set, ext_proc will check
    for header mutations beforce clearing the route cache. Failures due to this check will be counted under the
    clear_route_cache_ignored stat.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Added support for fetching credentials from the AWS credentials file, which only happens if credentials cannot be fetched
    from environment variables. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_aws_credentials_file`` to ``false``.
- area: http cookies
  change: |
    Changed internal format of http cookie to protobuf and added expiry timestamp. Processing expired cookie
    results in selection of a new upstream host and sending a new cookie to the client. Previous format of
    the cookie is still accepted, but is planned to be obsoleted in the future.
    This behavior change can be reverted by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.stateful_session_encode_ttl_in_cookie`` to ``false``.
- area: overload manager
  change: |
    Changed behavior of the overload manager to error on unknown overload
    manager actions. Prior it would silently fail.  This change can be reverted
    temporarily by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.overload_manager_error_unknown_action`` to
    false.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added check for existing metadata before setting metadata due to 'auto_sni', 'auto_san_validation', or
    'override_auto_sni_header' to prevent triggering ENVOY_BUG when an earlier filter has set the metadata.
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    Changed behavior of the fixed heap monitor to count unused mapped pages as
    free memory. This change can be reverted temporarily by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.count_unused_mapped_pages_as_free`` to false.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Filter metadata containing ext proc stats has been moved from ext-proc-logging-info to a namespace corresponding
    to the name of the ext_proc filter.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    The Max-Age attribute of Set-Cookie HTTP response header was being assigned a value representing Seconds Since
    the Epoch, causing cookies to expire in ~53 years. This was fixed an now it is being assinged a value representing
    the number of seconds until the cookie expires.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_use_standard_max_age_value`` to false.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix build FIPS compliance when using both FIPS mode and Wasm extensions (``--define boringssl=fips`` and ``--define wasm=v8``).
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fix a bug where the ext_authz filter will ignore the request body when the
    :ref:`pack_as_bytes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.BufferSettings.pack_as_bytes>` is set to true and
    HTTP authorization service is configured.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed the bug that updating :ref:`scope_key_builder
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.ScopedRoutes.scope_key_builder>`
    of SRDS config doesn't work and multiple HCM share the same ``scope_key_builder``.
- area: http
  change: |
    The :ref:`is_optional
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpFilter.is_optional>`
    field of HTTP filter can only be used for configuration loading of
    :ref:`HTTP filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpFilter>`
    and will be ignored for loading of route or virtual host level filter config. This behavioral change
    can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ignore_optional_option_from_hcm_for_route_config`` to false.
    You can also use
    :ref:`route/virtual host optional flag <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.FilterConfig.is_optional>`
    as a replacement of the feature.
- area: logging
  change: |
    Do not display GRPC_STATUS_NUMBER for non gRPC requests.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.validate_grpc_header_before_log_grpc_status`` to false.
- area: boringssl
  change: |
    Fixed the crash that occurs when contrib is compiled with ``boringssl=fips`` defined.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    The httpOnly attribute for Set-Cookie for tokens in HTTP response header was missing,
    causing tokens to be accessible from the JavaScript making the apps vulnerable.
    This was fixed now by marking the cookie as httpOnly.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_make_token_cookie_httponly`` to false.
- area: dependency
  change: |
    update Wasmtime and related deps -> 9.0.3 to resolve
    `CVE-2023-30624 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30624>`_.
- area: dependency
  change: |
    update C-ares -> 1.91.1 to resolve:

    - `CVE-2023-31130 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31130>`_.
    - `CVE-2023-31147 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31147>`_.
    - `CVE-2023-31124 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31124>`_.
