- area: bootstrap
  change: |
    Fixed an issue where the custom
    :ref:`header_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.header_prefix>`
    will result in crash at startup.

new_features:
- area: overload management
  change: |
    The fixed heap resource monitor can now calculate memory pressure as currently allocated memory divided by maximum heap size,
    giving more accurate and lower memory pressure values.
    This can avoid unnecessary load shedding or overload actions.
    To enable, set ``envoy.reloadable_features.fixed_heap_use_allocated`` to true.
    The default algorithm (heap_size - pageheap_unmapped - pageheap_free) does not discount for free memory in TCMalloc caches.
