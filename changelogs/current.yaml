  change: |
    The default configuration of Envoy will continue to trust internal addresses while in the future it will not trust them by default.
    If you have tooling such as probes on your private network which need to be treated as trusted (e.g. changing arbitrary ``x-envoy``
    headers) please explictily include those addresses or CIDR ranges into :ref:`internal_address_config
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.internal_address_config>`
    See the config examples from the above ``internal_address_config`` link. This default no trust internal address can be turned on by
    setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config`` to ``true``.

    any route.
- area: http_async_client

    Fixed the local reply and destroy order crashes when using the http async client for websocket handshake.
