behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: http
  change: |
    Remove the hop by hop TE header from downstream request headers if it's not set to ``trailers``, else keep it. This change can be
    temporarily reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_te`` to false.
- area: stats
  change: |
    The runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_include_histograms`` is now enabled by default.
    This causes the ``includeHistogram()`` method on ``Stats::SinkPredicates`` to filter histograms to
    be flushed to stat sinks.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: adaptive concurrency filter stats
  change: |
    Multiply the gradient value stat by 1000 to make it more granular (values will range between 500 and 2000).
- area: quic
  change: |
    :ref:`Server preferred address <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.QuicProtocolOptions.server_preferred_address_config>` is
    now sent to non-quiche quic clients when configured. This behavior can be disabled with runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_send_server_preferred_address_to_all_clients``.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Allowing <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_min_refresh_rate>` to go as low as 1s.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Upstream now excludes hosts set to ``DRAINING`` state via EDS from load balancing and panic routing
    threshold calculation. This feature can be disabled by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.exclude_host_in_eds_status_draining`` to false.
- area: golang
  change: |
    Change ``RegisterHttpFilterConfigFactoryAndParser`` to ``RegisterHttpFilterFactoryAndConfigParser``.
- area: QUIC
  change: |
    Port migration is default turned off. QUIC client connections will no longer attempt to migrate to a new port when connections
    is degrading. Can be manually turned on via
    :ref:`port_migration <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.QuicProtocolOptions.num_timeouts_to_trigger_port_migration>`.
- area: aws
  change: |
    AWS region string is now retrieved from environment and profile consistently within aws_request_signer and
    grpc_credentials/aws_iam extensions. Region field in aws_request_signer is now optional, explicitly configured
    xDS region will take preference. aws_request_signer documentation now reflects the region chain.
- area: http
  change: |
    Enable obsolete line folding in BalsaParser (for behavior parity with http-parser, the
    previously used HTTP/1 parser).

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: tracers
  change: |
    use unary RPC calls for OpenTelemetry trace exports, rather than client-side streaming connections.
- area: stateful_session
  change: |
    Support 0 TTL for proto-encoded cookies, which disables cookie expiration by Envoy.
- area: load balancing
  change: |
    Added randomization in locality load-balancing initialization. This helps desynchronizing Envoys across
    a fleet by randomizing the scheduler starting point. This can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.edf_lb_locality_scheduler_init_fix`` to false.
- area: load balancing
  change: |
    Added randomization in host load-balancing initialization. This helps desynchronizing Envoys across
    a fleet by randomizing the scheduler starting point. This can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.edf_lb_host_scheduler_init_fix`` to false.
- area: UDP and TCP tunneling
  change: |
    fixed a bug where second HTTP response headers received would cause Envoy to crash in cases where
    ``propagate_response_headers`` and retry configurations are enabled at the same time, and an upstream
    request is retried multiple times.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Reject xDS configurations where the rate-limit's :ref:`fill_rate <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.RateLimitSettings.fill_rate>`
    is set to Infinity or NaN.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Prevent Envoy from crashing at start up when the OpenTelemetry environment resource detector cannot detect any attributes.
- area: proxy protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a crash when Envoy is configured for PROXY protocol on both a listener and cluster, and the listener receives
    a PROXY protocol header with address type LOCAL (typically used for health checks).
- area: url matching
  change: |
    Fixed excessive CPU utilization when using regex URL template matcher.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed crash when HTTP request idle and per try timeouts occurs within backoff interval.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed crash bug with QUIC upstream + X.509v1 certificates.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in a proxy protocol header. Connections will instead be dropped/reset.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where TLVs with non utf8 characters were inserted as protobuf values into filter metadata circumventing
    ext_authz checks when ``failure_mode_allow`` is set to ``true``.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix crash due to uncaught exception when the operating system does not support an address type (such as IPv6) that is
    received in an mTLS client cert IP SAN. These SANs will be ignored. This applies only when using formatter
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_IP_SAN%``.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    When tunneling TCP over HTTP, closed the downstream connection (for writing only) when upstream trailers are read
    to support half close semantics during TCP tunneling.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.tcp_tunneling_send_downstream_fin_on_upstream_trailers`` to false.
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    Fixed JWT extractor, which concatenated headers with a comma, resultig in invalid tokens.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fix a timing issue when upstream requests are empty when decoding data and send local reply when that happends. This is
    controlled by ``envoy_reloadable_features_send_local_reply_when_no_buffer_and_upstream_request``.
- area: deps
  change: |
    Updated QUICHE dependencies to incorporate fixes for https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/32401.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Dynatrace resource detector: Only log warning message when no enrichment attributes are found.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`
- area: http

new_features:
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added
    :ref:`grpc_initial_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExtProcOverrides.grpc_initial_metadata>`
    config API to allow extending inherited metadata from
    :ref:`ExternalProcessor.grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.grpc_service>`
    and
    :ref:`ExtProcOverrides.grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExtProcOverrides.grpc_service>`
    with the new or updated values.
- area: aws_request_signing
  change: |
    Update ``aws_request_signing`` filter to support use as an upstream HTTP filter. This allows successful calculation of
    signatures after the forwarding stage has completed, particularly if the path element is modified.
- area: aws_lambda
  change: |
    Update ``aws_lambda`` filter to support use as an upstream HTTP filter. This allows successful calculation of
    signatures after the forwarding stage has completed, particularly if the path element is modified.
- area: grpc reverse bridge
  change: |
    Change HTTP status to 200 to respect the gRPC protocol. This may cause problems for incorrect gRPC clients expecting the filter
    to preserve HTTP 1.1 responses.  This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.grpc_http1_reverse_bridge_change_http_status`` to false.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added QUIC protocol option :ref:`send_disable_active_migration
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.QuicProtocolOptions.send_disable_active_migration>` to make the server send clients a transport
    parameter to discourage client endpoints from active migration.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    implemented
    :ref:`request_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.request_attributes>`
    and
    :ref:`response_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.response_attributes>`
    config APIs to enable sending and receiving attributes to/from the external processing server.
- area: access log
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`%UPSTREAM_CONNECTION_ID% <config_access_log_format_upstream_connection_id>` for the upstream connection
    identifier.
- area: aws_lambda
  change: |
    Added :ref:`host_rewrite <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.aws_lambda.v3.Config.host_rewrite>` config to be used
    during signature.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    added
    :ref:`metadata_options <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.metadata_options>`
    config API to enable sending and receiving metadata from/to the external processing server. Both typed and untyped dynamic
    metadata may be sent to the server. If
    :ref:`receiving_namespaces <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.MetadataOptions.receiving_namespaces>`
    is defined, returned metadata may be written to the specified allowed namespaces.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    added ``verify_signature`` foreign function to verify cryptographic signatures.
- area: monitoring
  change: |
    Add ``Envoy::ExecutionContext``, which is notified by ``ScopeTrackerScopeState``'s constructor and destructor. This feature is
    disabled by default, it can be enabled by runtime feature flag ``envoy.restart_features.enable_execution_context``. For more details,
    please see https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/32012.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Added :ref:`uri_template<envoy_v3_api_field_config.rbac.v3.Permission.uri_template>` which uses existing
    :ref:`UriTemplateMatchConfig<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.path.match.uri_template.v3.UriTemplateMatchConfig>`
    to allow use of glob patterns for URI path matching in RBAC.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added :ref:`selection_method <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.least_request.v3.LeastRequest>`
    option to the least request load balancer. If set to ``FULL_SCAN``,
    Envoy will select the host with the fewest active requests from the entire host set rather than
    :ref:`choice_count <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.least_request.v3.LeastRequest>`
    random choices.
- area: access_loggers
  change: |
    Added :ref:`Fluentd access logger <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.access_loggers.fluentd.v3.FluentdAccessLogConfig>`
    to support flushing access logs in `Fluentd format <https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/wiki/Forward-Protocol-Specification-v1>`_.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for the ``ECHO`` command.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    added an option to dynamically set a per downstream connection idle timeout period object under the key
    ``envoy.tcp_proxy.per_connection_idle_timeout_ms``. If this filter state value exists, it will override the idle timeout
    specified in the filter configuration and the default idle timeout.
- area: overload
  change: |
    added a :ref:`configuration option
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.append_local_overload>` to add
    ``x-envoy-local-overloaded`` header when Overload Manager is triggered.

deprecated:
- area: listener
  change: |
    deprecated runtime key ``overload.global_downstream_max_connections`` in favor of :ref:`downstream connections monitor
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>`.
