behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: wasm
  change: |
    The route cache will not be cleared by default if the wasm extension modified the request headers and
    the ABI version of wasm extension is larger then 0.2.1.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Remove previously deprecated xDS attributes from ``get_property``, use ``xds`` attributes instead.
- area: http
  change: |
    RFC1918 addresses are no longer considered to be internal addresses by default. This addresses a security
    issue for Envoy's in multi-tenant mesh environments. Please explicit set
    :ref:`internal_address_config
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.internal_address_config>`
    to retain the prior behavior.
    This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config`` to ``false``.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: access_log
  change: |
    New implementation of the JSON formatter will be enabled by default.
    The :ref:`sort_properties <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.JsonFormatOptions.sort_properties>` field will
    be ignored in the new implementation because the new implementation always sorts properties. And the new implementation
    will always keep the value type in the JSON output. For example, the duration field will always be rendered as a number
    instead of a string.
    This behavior change could be disabled temporarily by setting the runtime
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.logging_with_fast_json_formatter`` to false.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    The NaN and Infinity values of float will be serialized to ``null`` and ``"inf"`` respectively in the
    metadata (``DYNAMIC_METADATA``, ``CLUSTER_METADATA``, etc.) formatter.
- area: sds
  change: |
    Relaxed the backing cluster validation for Secret Discovery Service(SDS). Currently, the cluster that supports SDS,
    needs to be a primary cluster i.e. a non-EDS cluster defined in bootstrap configuration. This change relaxes that
    restriction i.e. SDS cluster can be a dynamic cluster. This change is enabled by default, and can be reverted by setting
    the runtime flag ``envoy.restart_features.skip_backing_cluster_check_for_sds`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    If the :ref:`pack_trace_reason <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.request_id.uuid.v3.UuidRequestIdConfig.pack_trace_reason>`
    is set to false, Envoy will not parse the trace reason from the ``x-request-id`` header to ensure reads and writes of
    trace reason be consistant.
    If the :ref:`pack_trace_reason <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.request_id.uuid.v3.UuidRequestIdConfig.pack_trace_reason>`
    is set to true and external ``x-request-id`` value is used, the trace reason in the external request id will not
    be trusted and will be cleared.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    :ref:`use_refresh_token <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.use_refresh_token>`
    is now enabled by default. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth2_use_refresh_token`` to false.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Enable UDP GRO in QUIC client connections by default. This behavior can be reverted by setting
    the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.prefer_quic_client_udp_gro`` to false.
- area: scoped_rds
  change: |
    The :ref:`route_configuration <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.ScopedRouteConfiguration.route_configuration>` field
    is supported when the ``ScopedRouteConfiguration`` resource is delivered via SRDS.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: tls
  change: |
    Support operations on IP SANs when the IP version is not supported by the host operating system, for example
    an IPv6 SAN can now be used on a host not supporting IPv6 addresses.
- area: scoped_rds
  change: |
    Fixes scope key leak and spurious scope key conflicts when an update to an SRDS resource changes the key.

# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Added the wasm vm reload support to reload wasm vm when the wasm vm is failed with runtime errors. See
    :ref:`failure_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.wasm.v3.PluginConfig.failure_policy>` for more details.
    The ``FAIL_RELOAD`` reload policy will be used by default.
- area: aws_request_signing
  change: |
    Added an optional field :ref:`credential_provider
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.aws_request_signing.v3.AwsRequestSigning.credential_provider>`
    to the AWS request signing filter to explicitly specify a source for AWS credentials.

    added ``clear_route_cache`` foreign function to clear the route cache.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added %DOWNSTREAM_LOCAL_EMAIL_SAN%, %DOWNSTREAM_PEER_EMAIL_SAN%, %DOWNSTREAM_LOCAL_OTHERNAME_SAN% and
    %DOWNSTREAM_PEER_OTHERNAME_SAN% substitution formatters.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added :ref:`QUIC stats debug visitor <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.quic.connection_debug_visitor.quic_stats.v3.Config>` to
    get more stats from the QUIC transport.

  change: |
    Added default-false ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_inspector_use_balsa_parser`` for HttpInspector to use BalsaParser.

  change: |
    Added support for scaling :ref:`max connection duration
    <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_config.overload.v3.ScaleTimersOverloadActionConfig.TimerType.HTTP_DOWNSTREAM_CONNECTION_MAX>`.
    This can be used to reduce the max connection duration in response to overload.

  change: |
    Set resource ``telemetry.sdk.*`` and scope ``otel.scope.name|version`` attributes for the OpenTelemetry tracer.

  change: |
    Added support for dynamic cluster selection in UDP proxy. The cluster can be set by one of the session filters
    by setting a per-session state object under the key ``envoy.udp_proxy.cluster``.
