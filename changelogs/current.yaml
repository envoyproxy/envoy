behavior_changes:
- area: tls-inspector
  change: |
    the listener filter tls inspector's stats ``connection_closed`` and ``read_error`` are removed. The new stats are introduced for listener, ``downstream_peek_remote_close`` and ``read_error`` :ref:`listener stats <config_listener_stats>`.
- area: config
  change: |
    Multiple SDS resources of multiple clusters or listeners are sent in a single SDS requests, instead of multiple SDS requests.
    This behavioral change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.combine_sds_requests`` to false.
- area: stats listener
  change: |
    Fixed metric tag extraction so that :ref:stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.stat_prefix>
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    envoy_listener_myprefix_downstream_cx_overflow{} to envoy_listener_downstream_cx_overflow{envoy_listener_address="myprefix"}.
    This does not affect the Prometheus name if stat_prefix is not set.
- area: stats listener
  change: |
    Fixed metric tag extraction so that worker_id is properly extracted from the listener stats. This changes the Prometheus name from
    envoy_listener_worker_1_downstream_cx_active{envoy_listener_address="0.0.0.0_10000"} to envoy_listener_downstream_cx_active{envoy_listener_address="0.0.0.0_10000", envoy_worker_id="1"} .
- area: stats server
  change: |
    Fixed metric tag extraction so that worker_id is properly extracted fromt the server stats. This changes the Prometheus name from
    envoy_server_worker_1_watchdog_miss{} to envoy_server_watchdog_miss{envoy_worker_id="1"}.
- area: stats thrift_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed metric tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.v3.ThriftProxy.stat_prefix>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    envoy_thrift_myprefix_request{} to envoy_thrift_request{envoy_thrift_prefix="myprefix"}.
- area: stats redis_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed metric tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.stat_prefix>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    envoy_redis_myprefix_command_pttl_latency_sum{} to envoy_redis_command_pttl_latency_sum{envoy_redis_prefix="myprefix"}.

minor_behavior_changes:
- area: thrift
  change: |
    add validate_clusters in :ref:`RouteConfiguration <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.v3.RouteConfiguration>` to override the default behavior of cluster validation.
- area: tls
  change: |
    if both :ref:`match_subject_alt_names <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_subject_alt_names>` and :ref:`match_typed_subject_alt_names <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_typed_subject_alt_names>` are specified, the former (deprecated) field is ignored. Previously, setting both fields would result in an error.
- area: tls
  change: |
    removed SHA-1 and RSA key transport cipher suites from the server-side defaults.
- area: http
  change: |
    the behavior of the :ref:`timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.KeepaliveSettings.timeout>`
    field has been modified to extend the timeout when *any* frame is received on the owning HTTP/2
    connection. This negates the effect of head-of-line (HOL) blocking for slow connections. If
    any frame is received the assumption is that the connection is working. This behavior change
    can be reverted by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_delay_keepalive_timeout`` runtime
    flag to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    changing the behavior for CONNECT and upgrade requests over HTTP/1.1 to not delay close. This behavioral change
    can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_delay_close_for_upgrades`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    the :ref:`dynamo filter <config_http_filters_dynamo>` has been moved to :ref:`contrib images <install_contrib>`.
- area: http-cache
  change: |
    http cache filter ``getCache`` interface changed from returning a reference to
    returning a shared_ptr - any third-party implementations of this interface will need to be
    updated accordingly. See changes to ``simple_http_cache.cc`` and ``simple_http_cache.h`` in
    `PR21114 <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/21114>`_ for example.
- area: lua
  change: |
    new function ``timestampString`` returning the time since epoch as a string. Supported
    resolutions are millisecond and microsecond.
- area: lua
  change: |
    export symbols of LuaJit by default on Linux. This is useful in cases where you have a lua script
    that loads shared object libraries, such as those installed via luarocks.
- area: admin
  change: |
    changed default regex engine for ``/stats?filter=`` from std::regex to RE2, improving
    filtering speed 20x.
- area: admin
  change: |
    added compile-time option ``--define=admin_html=disabled`` to disable HTML home page.
- area: skywalking
  change: |
    use request path as operation name of ENTRY/EXIT spans.
- area: skywalking
  change: |
    use upstream host address as ``addressUsedAtClient`` in propagation header.
- area: dns
  change: |
    allow propagating DNS responses with no records back to callers like strict_dns cluster,
    guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.cares_accept_nodata``.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    local_ratelimit will consume tokens of all matched descriptors sorted by tokens per second.
    This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_local_ratelimit_match_all_descriptors`` to false.
- area: router
  change: |
    get route config factories by the configuration proto full names by default. This behavior change
    can be reverted by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.get_route_config_factory_by_type``
    runtime flag to false.
  change: |
    add an ignore_port_in_host_matching config entry in RouteConfiguration. When set to true, port number(if any) in host
    header is ignored during host matching.
  change: |
    add an ignore_path_parameters_in_path_matching config entry in RouteConfiguration. When set to true, path-parameters(rfc1808) is ignored during path matching.
- area: lua
  change: |
    lua ``respond`` api will call ``sendLocalReply`` instead of ``encodeHeaders`` and ``encodeData``.
    This means that encoder filters will be correctly invoked, including adding configured response
    headers, etc. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.lua_respond_with_send_local_reply`` to false.
- area: logging
  change: |
    changed flag ``--log-format-escaped`` to only log one trailing newline per log line.
- area: logging
  change: |
    changed category name for access log filter extensions to ``envoy.access_loggers.extension_filters``.
- area: tracers
  change: |
    remove unnecessary "spawnChild" annotations in OpenCensus tracer.

bug_fixes:
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed HTTP/2 CONNECT to be RFC compliant, rather than following the abandoned extended connect draft.
    This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_rfc_connect`` to false.

- area: decompression
  change: |
    Fixed CVE-2022-29225: Decompressors can be zip bombed. Previously decompressors were
    susceptible to memory inflation in takes in which specially crafted payloads could cause a
    large amount of memory usage by Envoy. The max inflation payload size is now limited.
    This change can be reverted via the ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_compression_bomb_protection``
    runtime flag.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed CVE-2022-29227: Internal redirect crash for requests with body/trailers. Envoy would
    previously crash in some cases when processing internal redirects for requests with bodies or
    trailers if the redirect prompts an Envoy-generated local reply.
- area: oauth
  change: |
    Fixed CVE-2022-29226: oauth filter allows trivial bypass. The OAuth filter implementation does
    not include a mechanism for validating access tokens, so by design when the HMAC signed cookie
    is missing a full authentication flow should be triggered. However, the current implementation
    assumes that access tokens are always validated thus allowing access in the presence of any
    access token attached to the request.
- area: oauth
  change: |
    Fixed CVE-2022-29228: oauth filter calls continueDecoding() from within decodeHeaders(). The
    OAuth filter would try to invoke the remaining filters in the chain after emitting a local
    response, which triggers an ASSERT() in newer versions and corrupts memory on earlier versions.
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Fixed CVE-2022-29224: Segfault in GrpcHealthCheckerImpl. An attacker-controlled upstream server
    that is health checked using gRPC health checking can crash Envoy via a null pointer dereference
    in certain circumstances.
- area: runtime
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where was ``envoy.restart_features.no_runtime_singleton`` was inverted.
    Runtime singleton status is now guarded by non-inverted ``envoy.restart_features.remove_runtime_singleton``.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed an issue using the cluster wide CONNECT termination so it will successfully proxy payloads.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Fixed the LOGICAL_DNS and STRICT_DNS clusters to work for IPv6.

removed_config_or_runtime:
- area: compressor
  change: |

- area: dns
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_dns_ttl`` and legacy code paths.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_ext_authz_do_not_skip_direct_response_and_redirect`` runtime guard and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    deprecated ``envoy.reloadable_features.correct_scheme_and_xfp`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    deprecated ``envoy.reloadable_features.validate_connect`` and legacy code paths.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.new_tcp_connection_pool`` and legacy code paths.
- area: tls
  change: |
    fixed a bug when a certificate is invalid, ``days_until_expiration`` reports a big number. After this fix, when a certificate expires, it reports as ``0``.
- area: conn pool
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.conn_pool_delete_when_idle`` and legacy code paths.
- area: runtime
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.restart_features.no_runtime_singleton`` and replaced with ``envoy.restart_features.remove_runtime_singleton``.

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added formatters for :ref:`UPSTREAM_METADATA<config_access_log_format_upstream_host_metadata>` and :ref:`METADATA(UPSTREAM_HOST)<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.formatter.metadata.v3.Metadata>`.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added new access_log command operators to retrieve upstream connection information change: ``%UPSTREAM_PROTOCOL%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_SUBJECT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_ISSUER%``, ``%UPSTREAM_TLS_SESSION_ID%``, ``%UPSTREAM_TLS_CIPHER%``, ``%UPSTREAM_TLS_VERSION%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_CERT_V_START%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_CERT_V_END%``, ``%UPSTREAM_PEER_CERT%` and ``%UPSTREAM_FILTER_STATE%``.
  change: |
    added configuration for OpenTelemetry :ref:`resource_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.access_loggers.open_telemetry.v3.OpenTelemetryAccessLogConfig.resource_attributes>`.
- area: dns_resolver
  change: |
    added :ref:`include_unroutable_families<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.apple.v3.AppleDnsResolverConfig.include_unroutable_families>` to the Apple DNS resolver.
  change: |
    added support for multiple addresses. This is most valuable when used in conjunction with :ref:`ALL <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.DnsLookupFamily.ALL>` enabling full happy eyeballs support for Envoy (see detailed documentation :ref:`here <arch_overview_conn_pool>` but will also result in trying multiple addresses for resolvers doing only IPv4 or IPv6. This behavioral change can be temporarily disabled by setting runtime guard ``envoy.restart_features.remove_runtime_singleton`` to false.
- area: dubbo_proxy
  change: |
    added :ref:`dynamic routes discovery <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.DubboProxy.drds>` support to the dubbo proxy.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    added support for per-route :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExtProcOverrides.grpc_service>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    added new :ref:`file_system_buffer <config_http_filters_file_system_buffer>` http filter.
  change: |
    added a :ref:`configuration option <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http1ProtocolOptions.send_fully_qualified_url>` to send absolute URLs for HTTP/1.1.
- area: http
  change: |
    preserve case header formatter support innner formatter on Envoy headers in :ref:`formatter_type_on_envoy_headers <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.http.header_formatters.preserve_case.v3.PreserveCaseFormatterConfig.formatter_type_on_envoy_headers>`.
- area: http3
  change: |
    added :ref:`early_data_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.early_data_policy>` extension to allow upstream HTTP/3 sending requests over early data. If no extension is configured, HTTP/3 pool will send safe requests as early data to the host if the pool already cached 0-RTT credentials of that host. If those requests fail and the underlying connection pool supports TCP fallback, the request may be retried automatically. If the :ref:`default extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.early_data.v3.DefaultEarlyDataPolicy>` is configured, no requests are allowed to be sent as early data. Note that if any customized extension configures non-safe requests to be allowed over early data, the Envoy will not automatically retry them. If desired, explicitly config their :ref:`retry_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.retry_policy>`. This feature requires both ``envoy.reloadable_features.conn_pool_new_stream_with_early_data_and_http3`` and ``envoy.reloadable_features.http3_sends_early_data`` to be turned on.
- area: listener
  change: |
    added dynamic listener filter configuration for listener filters. :ref:`dynamic listener filter re-configuration<envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.ListenerFilter.config_discovery>`. This dynamic listener filter configuration is only supported in TCP listeners.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added flag to router to control downstream local close. :ref:`close_downstream_on_upstream_error <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.router.v3.Router.close_downstream_on_upstream_error>`.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added support for access logging.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added support for preserving header keys.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added support for propogating connection draining if local replies try to end downstream.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added support onLocalReply to inform filters of local replies.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    introduced thrift configurable encoder and bidirectional filters, which allows peeking and modifying the thrift response message.
- area: on_demand
  change: |
    :ref:`OnDemand <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.on_demand.v3.OnDemand>` got extended to hold configuration for on-demand cluster discovery. A similar message for :ref:`per-route configuration <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.on_demand.v3.PerRouteConfig>` is also added.
- area: proxy_protcol
  change: |
    added :ref:`allow_requests_without_proxy_protocol<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.listener.proxy_protocol.v3.ProxyProtocol.allow_requests_without_proxy_protocol>` to allow requests without proxy protocol on the listener from trusted downstreams as an opt-in flag.
- area: udp
  change: |
    added config to specify the UDP packet writer factory. See :ref:`udp_packet_packet_writer_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.UdpListenerConfig.udp_packet_packet_writer_config>`.
- area: build
  change: |
    enabled building arm64 envoy-distroless and envoy-tools :ref:`docker images <install_binaries>`.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`masked_remote_address <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RateLimit.Action.masked_remote_address>`.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`HTTP matching input functions <arch_overview_matching_api>` as descriptor producers.
- area: build
  change: |
    official released binary is now built with Clang 14.0.0.
- area: conn pool
  change: |
    Changed HTTP/2 connection pooling and the :ref:`ALPN pool <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.auto_config>` to remember the number of streams allowed by the endpoint and cap multiplexed streams for subsequent connections based on that. With that working, defaulted the ALPN pool to assume HTTP/2 will work, as it will only incur a latency hit once until the TLS handshake is complete, and then will cache that the effective stream limit is 1.  This behavioral change can be revered by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_concurrency_for_alpn_pool`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    added :ref:`cluster_header <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.cluster_header>` in :ref:`request_mirror_policies <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.request_mirror_policies>` to allow routing shadow request to the cluster specified in the request_header.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added :ref:`internal upstream transport <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.transport_sockets.internal_upstream.v3.InternalUpstreamTransport>` for passing metadata and filter state across the user space sockets and the internal listeners.
- area: router
  change:
    added :ref:`keep_empty_value <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HeaderValueOption.keep_empty_value>` to allow keeping empty values in custom headers.
- area: dubbo_proxy
  change: |
    added :ref:`metadata_match <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.RouteAction.metadata_match>` support to the dubbo proxy.
- area: network
  change: |
    extended conection balancer with :ref:`extend balance <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.ConnectionBalanceConfig.extend_balance>`, and added :ref:`Dlb connection balancer <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.network.connection_balance.dlb.v3alpha.Dlb>` to use `DLB <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/686372/intel-dynamic-load-balancer.html>`_ hardware to balance.
- area: router
  change: |
    added :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.stat_prefix>` support to generate route level statistics.
- area: matching
  change : |
    added support for matching authenticated inputs in network and HTTP matching data.
- area: network
  change: |
    the :ref:`client ssl auth filter <config_network_filters_client_ssl_auth>` has been moved to :ref:`contrib images <install_contrib>`.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    added :ref:`matcher <arch_overview_rbac_matcher>` for selecting connections and requests to different actions.

deprecated:
- area: dubbo_proxy
  change: |
    deprecated :ref:`old dubbo route config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.DubboProxy.route_config>`. Please use
    :ref:`multiple route config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.DubboProxy.multiple_route_config>` or
    :ref:`multiple route config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.dubbo_proxy.v3.DubboProxy.drds>` first.
- area: http
  change: |
    deprecate the short name ``preserve_case`` for the header formatter extension in favor of the fully-qualified name
    ``envoy.http.stateful_header_formatters.preserve_case``.
- area: matching
  change: |
    :ref:`google_re2 <envoy_v3_api_field_type.matcher.v3.RegexMatcher.google_re2>` has been deprecated.
