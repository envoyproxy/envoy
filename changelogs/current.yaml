behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    OAuth filter now URL-encodes URL in query parameters. These query parameters are decoded, leaving intact character sequences that must remain encoded in URLs. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_use_url_encoding`` to false.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Adds a new admin stats format option 'html-active' to display a periodically updated list of the top most frequently changed stats.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: quic
  change: |
    Access logging is now deferred to the QUIC ack listener, and roundtrip response time is added as a downstream timing metric. New runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_defer_logging_to_ack_listener`` can be used for revert this behavior.
- area: healthcheck
  change: |
    If active HC is enabled and a host is ejected by outlier detection, a successful active health check unejects the host and consider it healthy. This also clears all the outlier detection counters. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features_successful_active_health_check_uneject_host`` to ``false``.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    Tokens from local descriptor's token buckets are burned before tokens from the default token bucket.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Request authorities are now validated with a library function from QUICHE rather than nghttp2. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_validate_authority_with_quiche`` to ``false``.
- area: lua
  change: |
    dropped moonjit support.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Make the :ref:`grpc service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.grpc_service>` required.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Metadata is parsed with the QUICHE HPACK library, rather than nghttp2. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_decode_metadata_with_quiche`` to ``false``.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Changed HTTP/1 and HTTP/3 upstream streams not to disable reading (in case where downstream buffer reaches high watermark) till the full response headers have been received. This fixes a bug where Envoy upstream timeouts were not correctly adjusting to the fact that the response headers have already been sent from upstream. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.upstream_wait_for_response_headers_before_disabling_read`` to ``false``.
- area: custom response
  change: |
    Changed how the uri for redirect policy is specified. It can now be specified either as a single fully qualified string, or by specifying individual components of the uri.
- area: matchers
  change: |
    Moved all of the network input matchers to extensions. If you use network matchers and override extensions_build_config.bzl you will now need to include them explicitly.
- area: skywalking
  change: |
    If sw8 header is invalid, skywalking extension will create a new trace context and a null span respectively when sampling is enabled and disabled.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: stats
  change: |
    now updating upstream total connection stats as happy eyeballs connections are created.
- area: eds
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.multiplex_eds`` to disable eds multiplexing. Eds multiplexing is enabled by default, so that all subscriptions for the same resource type and management server reuse a single channel/mux.
    When eds multiplexing is disabled each subscription uses a dedicated channel/mux.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed the bug that custom tags of the route metadata type are not set for upstream spans.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    ensure the route configuration will be used to overwrite global configuration when processing the local reply.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed outlier detection ejections caused by opened circuit breakers.
- area: dependency
  change: |
    Add boringssl patch to resolve CVE-2023-0286. Note that the FIPS build is not patched/fixed.
- area: access log
  change: |
    in JSON logs, port numbers were logged as strings and are now logged as numbers (``%DOWNSTREAM_LOCAL_PORT%``, ``%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_PORT%``, ``%DOWNSTREAM_DIRECT_REMOTE_PORT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_LOCAL_PORT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_REMOTE_PORT%``).
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.format_ports_as_numbers`` to false.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Let onData always raise StopIterationAndWatermark when waiting for headers response, to avoid http errors (413 on request path, and 500 on response path) when data size goes above high watermark.
- area: http filter
  change: |
    Fix possible illegal memory access in the header_mutaion filter when the request is aborted before the request headers are received completely.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Initialize upstream network read filters via their ``onNewConnection()`` callback once the upstream connection has been established even if there is no data available for reading on the new upstream connection. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.initialize_upstream_filters`` to ``false``.

- area: router
  change: |
    support route info in upstream access log.
- area: lua
  change: |
    added an new option to the options of lua ``httpCall``. This allows to skip adding ``x-forwarded-for`` by setting ``{["send_xff"] = false}`` as the ``options``.

- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    added the support :ref:`pass_through_tlvs for listener <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.listener.proxy_protocol.v3.ProxyProtocol.pass_through_tlvs>`
    and :ref:`pass_through_tlvs for upsteam <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ProxyProtocolConfig.pass_through_tlvs>`.
    They can control which Proxy Protocol V2 TLVs can be passed through by listener and upstream separately.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    added support for propagating the response trailers in :ref:`TunnelingConfig <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.TunnelingConfig.propagate_response_trailers>` to the downstream info filter state.
- area: sni_dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    added an option to dynamically set the host used by the SNI dynamic forward proxy filter, by setting a filter state object under the key ``envoy.upstream.dynamic_host``.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`%DOWNSTREAM_TRANSPORT_FAILURE_REASON% <config_access_log_format_downstream_transport_failure_reason>` as a log command operator about why listener may have failed due to a transport socket error,
    including TLS handshake failures.

    added :ref:`header mutation http filter <config_http_filters_header_mutation>` which adds the ability to modify request and response headers in any position of HTTP filter chain.
- area: matching
  change: |
    added :ref:`Filter State Input <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.matching.common_inputs.network.v3.FilterStateInput>` for matching based on filter state objects.
- area: http
  change: |
    make adding ProxyProtocolFilterState in the HCM optional.
- area: sni_dynamic_forward_proxy

    on the connection open event. This option does not require periodic access logging enabled, and the other way around.
- area: http
  change: |
    add :ref:`periodic access logging <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.access_log_flush_interval>`
    to http access logs for long-lived requests (Websockets, CONNECT, etc). :ref:`%DURATION% <config_access_log_format_duration>` will
    be empty for mid-request logs. Enabling this may affect access loggers and filters that register as access loggers that expect to be called only once.
