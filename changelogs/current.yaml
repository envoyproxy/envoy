new_features:
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added support for request payloads in HTTP health checks. The ``send`` field in ``HttpHealthCheck`` can now be
    used to specify a request body to be sent during health checking. This feature supports both hex-encoded text
    and binary payloads, similar to TCP health checks. The payload can only be used with HTTP methods that support
    request bodies (``POST``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH``, ``OPTIONS``). Methods that must not have request bodies
    (``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``DELETE``, ``TRACE``) are validated and will throw an error if combined with payloads.
    The implementation is optimized to process the payload once during configuration and reuse it for all health
    check requests. See :ref:`HttpHealthCheck <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck>` for configuration details.
- area: router_check_tool
  change: |
    Added support for testing routes with :ref:`dynamic metadata matchers <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteMatch.dynamic_metadata>`
    in the router check tool. The tool now accepts a ``dynamic_metadata`` field in test input to set metadata
    that can be matched by route configuration. This allows comprehensive testing of routes that depend on
    dynamic metadata for routing decisions.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``filterState()`` on ``streamInfo()`` which provides access to filter state objects stored during request processing.
    This allows Lua scripts to retrieve string, boolean, and numeric values stored by various filters for use in routing decisions,
    header modifications, and other processing logic. See :ref:`Filter State API <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_filter_state_wrapper>`
    for more details.
- area: socket
  change: |
    Added :ref:``network_namespace_filepath <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.SocketAddress.network_namespace_filepath>`` to
    :ref:`SocketAddress <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.SocketAddress>`. This field allows specifying a Linux network namespace filepath
    for socket creation, enabling network isolation in containerized environments.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Add the :ref:`rate_limits
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.rate_limits>`
    field to generate rate limit descriptors. If this field is set, the
    :ref:`VirtualHost.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` or
    :ref:`RouteAction.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.rate_limits>` fields will be ignored. However,
    :ref:`RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits>`
    will take precedence over this field.
- area: observability
  change: |
    Added ``ENVOY_NOTIFICATION`` macro to track specific conditions in produiction environments.
- area: dns_filter, redis_proxy and prefix_matcher_map
  change: |
    Switch to using Radix Tree instead of Trie for performance improvements.
- area: load_reporting
  change: |
    Added support for endpoint-level load stats and metrics reporting. Locality load reports now include per
    endpoint statistics and metrics, but only for endpoints with updated stats, optimizing report size and efficiency.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Added support for resource attributes. The stat sink will use the resource attributes configured for the OpenTelemetry tracer via
    :ref:`resource_detectors <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.OpenTelemetryConfig.resource_detectors>`.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``virtualHost()`` to the Stream handle API, allowing Lua scripts to retrieve virtual host information. So far, the only method
    implemented is ``metadata()``, allowing Lua scripts to access virtual host metadata scoped to the specific filter name. See
    :ref:`Virtual host object API <config_http_filters_lua_virtual_host_wrapper>` for more details.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Switch the IP matcher to use LC-Trie for performance improvements.
