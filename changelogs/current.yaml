- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    Fixed a resource leak in global connection limit tracking that caused permanent connection rejections when using
    load shedding (e.g., ``envoy.load_shed_points.tcp_listener_accept``). When connections were rejected due to load
    shedding after passing the global connection limit check, the allocated connection limit resource was not released,
    causing the connection counter to become incorrect and leading to ``failed_updates`` in the resource monitor. This
    resulted in permanent connection rejections even after load subsided. The fix ensures that connection limit
    resources are properly released when connections are rejected due to load shedding. Also added defensive resource
    cleanup for edge cases where address processing fails (e.g., ``localAddress()`` or ``peerAddress()`` errors).
