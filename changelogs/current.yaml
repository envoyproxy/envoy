behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fix a crash in the TCP connection pool that occurs during downstream connection teardown when large requests
    or responses trigger flow control.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_balsa_allow_cr_or_lf_at_request_start`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.original_src_fix_port_exhaustion`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`use_hash_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.WeightedCluster.use_hash_policy>`
    field to :ref:`WeightedCluster <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.WeightedCluster>` to enable
    route-level hash policies for weighted cluster selection. When set to ``true``,
    the existing route-level :ref:`hash_policy
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.hash_policy>`
    will be used for consistent hashing between weighted clusters, ensuring that requests
    with the same hash value (e.g., same session ID, user ID, etc.) will consistently be
    routed to the same weighted cluster, enabling session affinity and consistent load
    balancing behavior.
- area: stats
  change: |
    Added support to remove unused metrics from memory for extensions that
    support evictable metrics. This is done :ref:`periodically
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.stats_eviction_interval>`
    during the metric flush.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added :ref:`record_upstream_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.tap.v3.Tap.record_upstream_connection>`
    to determine whether upstream connection information is recorded in the HTTP buffer trace output.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added new option to support :ref:`base64 encoded server ID
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.quic.connection_id_generator.quic_lb.v3.Config.server_id_base64_encoded>`
    in QUIC-LB.
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added support for request payloads in HTTP health checks. The ``send`` field in ``HttpHealthCheck`` can now be
    used to specify a request body to be sent during health checking. This feature supports both hex-encoded text
    and binary payloads, similar to TCP health checks. The payload can only be used with HTTP methods that support
    request bodies (``POST``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH``, ``OPTIONS``). Methods that must not have request bodies
    (``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``DELETE``, ``TRACE``) are validated and will throw an error if combined with payloads.
    The implementation is optimized to process the payload once during configuration and reuse it for all health
    check requests. See :ref:`HttpHealthCheck <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck>` for configuration details.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support for generating and propagating a request ID on synthesized upstream HTTP requests when tunneling requests.
    It can be configured using :ref:`request_id_extension
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.TunnelingConfig.request_id_extension>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added support for per-route compressor library override in the HTTP compressor filter.
    Routes can now specify a different compressor library (e.g., gzip, brotli) via the
    :ref:`compressor_library <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.compressor.v3.CompressorOverrides.compressor_library>`
    field in the per-route configuration. This allows different routes to use different
    compression algorithms and settings while maintaining the same filter configuration.
- area: router_check_tool
  change: |
    Added support for testing routes with :ref:`dynamic metadata matchers <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteMatch.dynamic_metadata>`
    in the router check tool. The tool now accepts a ``dynamic_metadata`` field in test input to set metadata
    that can be matched by route configuration. This allows comprehensive testing of routes that depend on
    dynamic metadata for routing decisions.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added :ref:`disable_token_encryption
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.disable_token_encryption>` option to the OAuth2 filter to
    store ID and access tokens without encryption when running in trusted environments.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``filterState()`` to ``streamInfo()`` which provides access to filter state objects stored during request processing.
    This allows Lua scripts to retrieve string, boolean, and numeric values stored by various filters for use in routing decisions,
    header modifications, and other processing logic. See :ref:`Filter State API <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_filter_state_wrapper>`
    for more details.
- area: socket
  change: |
    Added ``network_namespace_filepath`` to :ref:`SocketAddress <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.SocketAddress>`. This field allows
    specifying a Linux network namespace filepath for socket creation, enabling network isolation in containerized environments.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added the :ref:`rate_limits
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.rate_limits>`
    field to generate rate limit descriptors. If this field is set, the
    :ref:`VirtualHost.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` or
    :ref:`RouteAction.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.rate_limits>` fields will be ignored. However,
    :ref:`RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits>`
    will take precedence over this field.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Enhanced the rate limit filter to support substitution formatters for descriptors that generated
    at the stream complete phase. Before this change, substitution formatters at the stream complete
    phase cannot work because rate limit filter does not provide the necessary context.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added cluster-scope command support with flexible response handling framework.
- area: observability
  change: |
    Added ``ENVOY_NOTIFICATION`` macro to track specific conditions in production environments.
- area: dns_filter, redis_proxy and prefix_matcher_map
  change: |
    Switch to using Radix Tree instead of Trie for performance improvements.
- area: header_to_metadata
  change: |
    Added optional statistics collection for the Header-To-Metadata filter. When the :ref:`stat_prefix
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.header_to_metadata.v3.Config.stat_prefix>` field is configured,
    the filter emits detailed counters for rule processing, metadata operations, etc. See
    :ref:`Header-To-Metadata filter statistics <config_http_filters_header_to_metadata>` for details.
- area: load_reporting
  change: |
    Added support for endpoint-level load stats and metrics reporting. Locality load reports now include per
    endpoint statistics and metrics, but only for endpoints with updated stats, optimizing report size and efficiency.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    Added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.http2_server_go_away_and_close_on_dispatch``
    that sends ``GOAWAY`` and closes connections for HTTP/2 server processing of requests. When
    a ``GOAWAY`` frame is submitted by this load shed point, the counter ``http2.goaway_sent`` will be
    incremented.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`request_body_buffer_limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.request_body_buffer_limit>` and
    :ref:`request_body_buffer_limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.request_body_buffer_limit>` configuration fields
    to enable buffering of large request bodies beyond connection buffer limits.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Added support for resource attributes. The stat sink will use the resource attributes configured for the OpenTelemetry tracer via
    :ref:`resource_detectors <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.OpenTelemetryConfig.resource_detectors>`.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`custom_metric_conversions
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.stat_sinks.open_telemetry.v3.SinkConfig.custom_metric_conversions>`. This allows renaming stats,
    adding static labels, and aggregating multiple stats into generated metrics.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``virtualHost()`` to the Stream handle API, allowing Lua scripts to retrieve virtual host information. So far, the only method
    implemented is ``metadata()``, allowing Lua scripts to access virtual host metadata scoped to the specific filter name. See
    :ref:`Virtual host object API <config_http_filters_lua_virtual_host_wrapper>` for more details.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for per-route gRPC service override in the ``ext_authz`` HTTP filter. This allows different routes
    to use different external authorization backends by configuring a
    :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.CheckSettings.grpc_service>`
    in the per-route ``check_settings``. Routes without this configuration continue to use the default
    authorization service.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added :ref:`status_on_error <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.status_on_error>`
    to the ``ext_proc`` HTTP filter. This allows configuring the HTTP status code returned to the downstream
    client when communication with the external processor fails (e.g., gRPC error). Previously, these cases returned a
    fixed ``500``.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Introduced a new
    :ref:`ProcessingRequestModifier <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.processing_request_modifier>`
    config and corresponding interface to enable modifying the ``ProcessingRequest`` before it is sent on the wire. Sample use cases include
    modifying attribute and metadata keys to abstract away filter details. If the config is not set, then there is no behavior change.
    Supports per-route overrides.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added :ref:`trace_context_option <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.ZipkinConfig.trace_context_option>` enum
    in the Zipkin tracer config. When set to ``USE_B3_WITH_W3C_PROPAGATION``, the tracer will:
    extract trace information from W3C trace headers when B3 headers are not present (downstream),
    and inject both B3 and W3C trace headers for upstream requests to maximize compatibility.
    The default value ``USE_B3`` maintains backward compatibility with B3-only behavior.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Enhanced Zipkin tracer with advanced collector configuration via
    :ref:`collector_service <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.ZipkinConfig.collector_service>`
    using ``HttpService``. New features include:

    #. **Custom HTTP Headers**: Add headers to collector requests for custom metadata, service identification,
       and collector-specific routing.

    #. **Full URI Parsing**: The ``uri`` field now supports both path-only (``/api/v2/spans``) and
       full URI formats (``https://zipkin-collector.example.com/api/v2/spans``). When using full URIs,
       Envoy automatically extracts hostname and path components - hostname sets the HTTP ``Host`` header,
       and path sets the request path. Path-only URIs fall back to using the cluster name as the hostname.

    When configured, ``collector_service`` takes precedence over legacy configuration fields (``collector_cluster``,
    ``collector_endpoint``, ``collector_hostname``), which will be deprecated in a future release. Legacy configuration
    does not support custom headers or URI parsing.
- area: composite
  change: |
    Allow the composite filter to be configured to insert a filter into the filter chain outside of the decode headers lifecycle phase.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Switched the IP matcher to use LC-Trie for performance improvements.
- area: tls_inspector
  change: |
    Added dynamic metadata when failing to parse the ``ClientHello``.
- area: matching
  change: |
    Added :ref:`NetworkNamespaceInput
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.matching.common_inputs.network.v3.NetworkNamespaceInput>` to the
    matcher framework. This input returns the listener address's ``network_namespace_filepath``
    for use with :ref:`filter_chain_matcher
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.filter_chain_matcher>`, enabling filter chain
    selection based on the Linux network namespace of the bound socket. On non-Linux platforms,
    the input returns an empty value and connections use the default filter chain.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Enabled use of :ref:`NetworkNamespaceInput
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.matching.common_inputs.network.v3.NetworkNamespaceInput>` in the
    network RBAC filter's matcher. This allows RBAC policies to evaluate the Linux network namespace
    of the listening socket via the generic matcher API.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``route()`` to the Stream handle API, allowing Lua scripts to retrieve route information. So far, the only method
    implemented is ``metadata()``, allowing Lua scripts to access route metadata scoped to the specific filter name. See
    :ref:`Route object API <config_http_filters_lua_route_wrapper>` for more details.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Added a new ``%TYPED_CEL%`` formatter command that, unlike ``%CEL%``, can output non-string values (number, boolean, null, etc.)
    when used in formatting contexts that accept non-string values, such as
    :ref:`json_format <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SubstitutionFormatString.json_format>`. The new command is introduced
    so as to not break compatibility with the existing command's behavior.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Enabled use of :ref:`NetworkNamespaceInput
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.matching.common_inputs.network.v3.NetworkNamespaceInput>` in the
    network and HTTP RBAC filters' matchers. This allows RBAC policies to evaluate the Linux network
    namespace of the listening socket via the generic matcher API.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added a new Logging ABI that allows modules to emit logs in the standard Envoy logging stream under ``dynamic_modules`` ID.
    In the Rust SDK, they are available as ``envoy_log_info``, etc.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added ``upstream_rq_per_cx`` histogram to track requests per connection for monitoring connection reuse efficiency.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added
    :ref:`stream_flush_timeout
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.stream_flush_timeout>`
    to allow for configuring a stream flush timeout independently from the stream idle timeout.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added support for header removal based on header key matching. The new
    :ref:`remove_on_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.common.mutation_rules.v3.HeaderMutation.remove_on_match>`
    allows removing headers that match a specified key pattern. This enables more flexible and
    dynamic header manipulation based on header names.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Added a new metric ``db_build_epoch`` to track the build timestamp of the MaxMind geolocation database files.
    This can be used to monitor the freshness of the databases currently in use by the filter.
    See `MaxMind-DB build_epoch <https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/#build_epoch>`_ for more details.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    Added a new scaled timer type ``HttpDownstreamStreamFlush`` to the overload manager. This allows
    Envoy to scale the periodic timer for flushing downstream responses based on resource pressure.
    The new timer can be configured via the
    :ref:`ScaleTimersOverloadActionConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.overload.v3.ScaleTimersOverloadActionConfig>`.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    Support :ref:`field_selector<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.thrift_to_metadata.v3.Rule.field_selector>`
    to extract specified fields in thrift body for thrift_to_metadata http filter.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added support for counters, gauges, histograms, and their vector variants to the dynamic modules API.
- area: dns_resolver
  change: |
    Added :ref:`max_udp_channel_duration
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.cares.v3.CaresDnsResolverConfig.max_udp_channel_duration>`
    configuration field to the c-ares DNS resolver. This allows periodic refresh of the UDP channel
    to help avoid stale socket states and provide better load distribution across UDP ports.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added ``max_downstream_connection_duration_jitter_percentage`` to allow adding a jitter to the max downstream connection duration.
    This can be used to avoid thundering herd problems with many clients being disconnected and possibly reconnecting at the same time.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added ``setUpstreamOverrideHost`` method to AsyncClient StreamOptions to enable direct host routing
    that bypasses load balancer selection.

deprecated:
