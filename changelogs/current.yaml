    New implementation of the JSON formatter will be enabled by default.
    The :ref:`sort_properties <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.JsonFormatOptions.sort_properties>` field will
    be ignored in the new implementation because the new implementation always sorts properties. And the new implementation
    will always keep the value type in the JSON output. For example, the duration field will always be rendered as a number
    instead of a string.
    This behavior change could be disabled temporarily by setting the runtime
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.logging_with_fast_json_formatter`` to false.
