  change: |
    Fixed a bug in :ref:`preconnecting <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.PreconnectPolicy>` where established connection
    unused capacity was not considered in the logic to establish new connections, resulting in new connections anytime there was not
    a connection currently in the process of being established. This resulted in far too many connections being established, with the only
    bounds being cluster circuit breaker limits or upstream service limits.
