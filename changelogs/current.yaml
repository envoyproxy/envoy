behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    OAuth filter now URL-encodes URL in query parameters. These query parameters are decoded, leaving intact character sequences that must remain encoded in URLs. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_use_url_encoding`` to false.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: quic
  change: |
    Access logging is now deferred to the QUIC ack listener, and roundtrip response time is added as a downstream timing metric. New runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_defer_logging_to_ack_listener`` can be used for revert this behavior.
- area: healthcheck
  change: |
    If active HC is enabled and a host is ejected by outlier detection, a successful active health check unejects the host and consider it healthy. This also clears all the outlier detection counters. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features_successful_active_health_check_uneject_host`` to ``false``.

- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    Tokens from local descriptor's token buckets are burned before tokens from the default token bucket.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: stats
  change: |
    now updating upstream total connection stats as happy eyeballs connections are created.
- area: eds
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.multiplex_eds`` to disable eds multiplexing. Eds multiplexing is enabled by default, so that all subscriptions for the same resource type and management server reuse a single channel/mux.
    When eds multiplexing is disabled each subscription uses a dedicated channel/mux.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed the bug that custom tags of the route metadata type are not set for upstream spans.
- area: dependency
  change: |
    Add boringssl patch to resolve CVE-2023-0286. Note that the FIPS build is not patched/fixed.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`
- area: config

- area: dns
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.dns_multiple_addresses`` runtime flag and legacy code paths.
- area: router
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.get_route_config_factory_by_type`` runtime flag. The flag is no longer needed as the behavior is now the default.
- area: http
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_delay_keepalive_timeout`` and legacy code paths.
- area: http
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.local_ratelimit_match_all_descriptors`` and legacy code paths.

- area: http
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_rfc_connect`` and legacy code path.
- area: http
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_concurrency_for_alpn_pool`` and legacy code path.
- area: http3
  change: |
    removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.conn_pool_new_stream_with_early_data_and_http3`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    enhanced observability into local close for :ref:`%RESPONSE_CODE_DETAILS% <config_http_conn_man_details>`.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    allow :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.OpenTelemetryConfig.grpc_service>` to be optional. This enables a means to disable collection of traces.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added :ref:`ring hash extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.ring_hash.v3.RingHash>` to suppport the :ref:`load balancer policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.load_balancing_policy>`.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added :ref:`maglev extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.maglev.v3.Maglev>` to suppport the :ref:`load balancer policy <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.load_balancing_policy>`.
- area: router
  change: |
    support route info in upstream access log.
- area: lua
  change: |
    added an new option to the options of lua ``httpCall``. This allows to skip adding ``x-forwarded-for`` by setting ``{["send_xff"] = false}`` as the ``options``.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    added support for propagating the response trailers in :ref:`TunnelingConfig <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.TunnelingConfig.propagate_response_trailers>` to the downstream info filter state.
