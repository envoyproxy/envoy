behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: lua
  change: |
    Fix a bug where Lua filters may result in Envoy crashes when setting response body to a
    larger payload (greater than the body buffer limit).
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fix a crash in the TCP connection pool that occurs during downstream connection teardown when large requests
    or responses trigger flow control.

# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`
- area: jwt_authn

- area: http
  change: |

- area: quic
  change: |

- area: http
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.original_src_fix_port_exhaustion`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``drainConnectionUponCompletion()`` to the Lua filter stream info API. This allows Lua scripts
    to mark connections for draining, which adds a ``Connection: close`` header for HTTP/1.1 or sends a
    ``GOAWAY`` frame for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Added ``sign`` foreign function to create cryptographic signatures.
    See :ref:`Wasm foreign functions <arch_overview_wasm_foreign_functions>` for more details.
