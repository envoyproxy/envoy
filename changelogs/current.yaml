# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Remove previously deprecated xDS attributes from ``get_property``, use ``xds`` attributes instead.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: access_log
  change: |
    New implementation of the JSON formatter will be enabled by default.
    The :ref:`sort_properties <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.JsonFormatOptions.sort_properties>` field will
    be ignored in the new implementation because the new implementation always sorts properties. And the new implementation
    will always keep the value type in the JSON output. For example, the duration field will always be rendered as a number
    instead of a string.
    This behavior change could be disabled temporarily by setting the runtime
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.logging_with_fast_json_formatter`` to false.

    The NaN and Infinity values of float will be serialized to ``null`` and ``"inf"`` respectively in the
    metadata (``DYNAMIC_METADATA``, ``CLUSTER_METADATA``, etc.) formatter.

  change: |
    Added an optional field :ref:`credential_provider
