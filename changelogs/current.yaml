behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: http2
  change: |
    Sets runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to true by default.
- area: dfp
  change: |
    Setting :ref:`dns_query_timeout
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_query_timeout>`
    to 0 will disable the the Envoy DNS query timeout and use the underlying DNS implementation timeout.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    When :ref:`mode_override <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse.mode_override>`
    headers/trailers modes have the value ``DEFAULT`` (unset), no change will be made to the processing
    mode set in the filter configuration.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Ignore request_header_mode field of :ref:`mode_override <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse.mode_override>`
    when comparing the mode_override against allowed_override_modes as request_header mode override is not applicable.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Support extension regex fuctions(e.g. ``re.extract``, ``re.capture`, ``re.captureN``) in CEL.
- area: http
  change: |
    :ref:`generate_request_id
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.generate_request_id>`
    will generate a request id on non-present and now on empty ``x-request-id`` header.
- area: aws
  change: |
    AWS request signing and AWS Lambda extensions will now no longer return empty credentials (and fail to sign) when
    credentials are still pending from the async credential providers. If all providers are unable to retrieve credentials
    then the original behaviour with a signing failure will occur.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    The formatter ``%CEL%`` and ``%METADATA%`` will be treated as built-in formatters and could be used directly in the
    substitution format string if the related extensions are linked.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: dfp
  change: |
    Fixes a bug when loading a DNS cache entry with an empty authority/host header. This fix can be reverted by setting
    runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_fail_on_empty_host_header`` to ``false``.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed query parameter matcher to properly implement
    :ref:`present_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.QueryParameterMatcher.present_match>`. Previously, the
    matcher would incorrectly handle ``present_match`` configurations by treating them as default present checks. This
    behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime feature
    ``envoy_reloadable_features_enable_new_query_param_present_match_behavior`` to ``false``.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixes a bug when TCP is tunneled over HTTP and upstream connection closed before response headers received to the stream.
    The fix is to run the retry logic in a different event loop iteration to allow cleanup of the closed connection before retrying.
    This fix can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.tcp_proxy_retry_on_different_event_loop`` to ``false``.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed OAuth2 credential injector to send scope (if specified) to authorization server when requesting new access
    token using ``client_credentials`` flow.
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in :ref:`preconnecting <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.PreconnectPolicy>` where established connection
    unused capacity was not considered in the logic to establish new connections, resulting in new connections anytime there was not
    a connection currently in the process of being established. This resulted in far too many connections being established, with the only
    bounds being cluster circuit breaker limits or upstream service limits.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Removed validation constraint on :ref:`disabled <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthzPerRoute.disabled>` so
    that it can be set to false to enable the filter when it is  by :ref:`default-disabled for the filter chain
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpFilter.disabled>`.
- area: original_src filter
  change: |
    Set IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT socket option in the original_src filter to prevent port exhaustion caused by the
    kernel prematurely reserving ephemeral ports. This behavior change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.original_src_fix_port_exhaustion`` to ``false``.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Fixed a crash bug when the DNS resolution status is completed, but the response is empty.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where socket options specified only on an additional address were not applied unless
    :ref:`socket_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.socket_options>` on the listener is set.
    Now additional address :ref:`socket_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.AdditionalAddress.socket_options>` are correctly
    applied even if the listener has no socket options configured.
- area: udp
  change: |
    Fixed wrong metric calculation of 'downstream_rx_datagram_dropped'.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed the jwks fetcher to set the :scheme pseudo header according to the uri ('http' or 'https').
    Before the :scheme header was always 'http'.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.jwt_fetcher_use_scheme_from_uri`` to false.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the addresses cannot be updated partially even if the reuse port is enabled.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug for the :ref:`extension
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.ext_proc.response_processors.save_processing_response.v3.SaveProcessingResponse>` where the
    :ref:`response <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse>` from the external processor was being saved to
    filter state after iterating through the filter chain.

  change: |
    Added :ref:`ignore_http_11_upgrade
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http1ProtocolOptions.ignore_http_11_upgrade>`
    to ignore HTTP/1.1 Upgrade values matching any of the supplied matchers.
- area: http
  change: |
    Made the :ref:`lua <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.lua.v3.Lua>` work as an upstream filter.
- area: dfp
  change: |
    The DFP cluster will now use the async lookup path to do DNS resolutions for null hosts. This behavioral change
    can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_cluster_resolves_hosts``
    to false.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Add the option to specify SameSite cookie attribute values for oauth2 supported cookies.
    To specify ``SameSite`` attribute, choose one of the values from ``strict``, ``lax`` or ``none``. If not specified,
    a default value of ``disabled`` will be assigned and there will be no ``SameSite`` value in the cookie attribute. See
    :ref:`apply_on_stream_done <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.cookie_configs>`
    for more details.
- area: spiffe
  change: |
    Added :ref:`trust_bundles
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SPIFFECertValidatorConfig.trust_bundles>`
    to the SPIFFE certificate validator configuration. This field allows specifying a SPIFFE trust
    bundle mapping as a ``DataSource``. If both ``trust_bundles`` and ``trust_domains`` are specified,
    ``trust_bundles`` takes precedence.
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    Added support to monitor container CPU utilization in Linux K8s environment using
    :ref:`existing extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.cpu_utilization.v3.CpuUtilizationConfig>`.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added :ref:`virtualClusterName() <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_virtual_cluster_name>` API to the Stream Info
    Object to get the name of the virtual cluster matched.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added an UDP extension for tap custom sink.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support for outlier detection in UDP proxy. This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_udp_proxy_outlier_detection`` to ``false``.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Add support for the inbound_only and graceful query params of /drain_listeners to be used together by
    implementing directional draining in DrainManager.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added alpha support for asynchronous load balancing. See
    :ref:`load balancing policies overview <arch_overview_load_balancing_policies>` for more details. Support can
    be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.async_host_selection`` to ``false``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added an :ref:`extension
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.quic.connection_id_generator.quic_lb.v3.Config>` to support QUIC-LB draft standard for
    connection ID generation.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Adding support for a new body mode: ``FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`` in the ``ext_proc`` filter
    :ref:`processing_mode <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.processing_mode>`.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Added support for injecting custom Type-Length-Value (TLV) entries into the Proxy Protocol v2 header for upstream
    transport sockets. Custom TLVs can be defined both in the endpoint host's typed metadata under the
    ``envoy.transport_sockets.proxy_protocol`` namespace and at the configuration level via the ``ProxyProtocolConfig``'s
    ``added_tlvs`` field. Host-level TLV definitions override config-level entries when the same type is specified, allowing
    default TLVs to be set globally, while enabling further per-endpoint customizations.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added ``QUERY_PARAM`` support for substitution formatter. See :ref:`access log formatter <config_access_log_format>`
    for more details.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added ``CUSTOM_FLAGS`` support for substitution formatter. See :ref:`access log formatter <config_access_log_format>`
    for more details.
- area: formatter
  change: |

    for more details.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`max_metadata_size <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_metadata_size>` to make
    HTTP/2 metadata limits configurable.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`backoff_options <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.backoff_options>`
    to configure the backoff strategy for TCP proxy retries.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for multi-key commands on transactions.
- area: redis_proxy
  change: |
    Added :ref:`custom_commands <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy>` to support
    configuring custom commands for redis proxy.
- area: dfp
  change: |
    Added a feature to disable DNS refresh on failure by setting :ref:`disable_dns_refresh_on_failure
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.disable_dns_refresh_on_failure>` to
    ``true``. By enabling this feature, the failed hosts will now be treated as a cache miss.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Reporting a locality_stats to LRS server when ``rq_issued > 0``, disable by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.report_load_with_rq_issued`` to ``false``.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added support for clearing the route cache explicitly in the Lua filter.
    See :ref:`clearRouteCache() <config_http_filters_lua_stream_handle_api_clear_route_cache>` for more details.

    Added :ref:`attribute <arch_overview_attributes>` ``upstream.locality`` to obtain upstream locality information.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added the initial support for shared libraries to be loaded by Envoy at runtime. Please refer to the overview documentation for the
    feature :ref:`here <arch_overview_dynamic_modules>`.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added an :ref:`extension
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.ext_proc.response_processors.save_processing_response.v3.SaveProcessingResponse>` to save the
    :ref:`response <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse>` from the external processor to filter state.
- area: http
  change: |
    Made the :ref:`credential injector filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.credential_injector.v3.CredentialInjector>`
    work as an upstream filter.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added :ref:`clear_route_cache <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.lua.v3.Lua.clear_route_cache>` support to
    control the route cache clearing behavior in the Lua filter.
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    Added :ref:`jwt_max_token_size <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.jwt_authn.v3.JwtCacheConfig.jwt_max_token_size>` to make
    max token size configurable.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    added :ref:`an option <config_network_filters_tcp_proxy_receive_before_connect>` to allow filters to read from the
    downstream connection before TCP proxy has opened the upstream connection, by setting a filter state object for the key
    ``envoy.tcp_proxy.receive_before_connect``.
- area: rate_limit
  change: |
    Added the explict runtime switch
    :ref:`filter_enabled <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.filter_enabled>` and
    :ref:`filter_enforced <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.filter_enforced>` to control the
    filter behavior.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added :ref:`proxy_protocol_tlvs
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.proxy_protocol_tlvs>` to the TCP proxy filter.
    This field allows specifying PROXY protocol TLVs to be added in the PROXY protocol state created by the TCP proxy filter.
    TLVs added in the PROXY protocol state will be added to the PROXY protocol v2 header sent upstream.
- area: sockets
  change: |
    Added an :ref:`io_uring <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.socket_interface.v3.DefaultSocketInterface.io_uring_options>` option in
