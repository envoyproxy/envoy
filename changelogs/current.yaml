- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed upstream client to not close connection when idle timeout fires before the connection is established.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.codec_client_enable_idle_timer_only_when_connected`` to ``false``.

new_features:
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added :ref:`allow_failed_matcher <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.allow_failed_matcher>`
    to allow requests to proceed to upstream as unauthenticated when OAuth validation fails (missing, invalid, or expired
    credentials) and the request matches the configured matchers. This enables graceful degradation patterns where services
    can handle both authenticated and unauthenticated requests. When triggered, all OAuth cookies are stripped and context
    headers ``x-envoy-oauth-status: failed`` and ``x-envoy-oauth-failure-reason`` are added. The matcher evaluation follows
    priority order: ``pass_through_matcher`` > ``allow_failed_matcher`` > ``deny_redirect_matcher`` > default OAuth behavior.
