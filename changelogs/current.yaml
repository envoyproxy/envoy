bug_fixes:
- area: release
  change: |
    Container (Ubuntu/distroless) updates, and fixed permissions for distroless config directory.
- area: dynatrace
  change: |
    Fixed a division by zero bug in the Dynatrace sampling controller that occurred when ``total_wanted`` was less than
    ``top_k_size``. The calculation was refactored to avoid the intermediate division that could result in zero.
