    The failed wasm vm with runtime errors will be reloaded by default. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime
    flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.wasm_failure_reload_by_default`` to false or by setting the
    :ref:`failure_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.wasm.v3.PluginConfig.failure_policy>`
    to ``FAIL_OPEN`` or ``FAIL_CLOSED`` explicitly.
