  change: |
    CacheFilter (WIP) has been completely reworked. Any existing cache implementations
    will need to be modified to fit the new API. The new cache API is much simpler, as
    individual cache implementations no longer need to comprehend various http headers,
    only read and write at keys. Cache filter now handles "thundering herds" - if
    multiple requests for the same resource arrive before the cache is populated,
    now only one request goes upstream, and there is only one insert to the cache.
    Range requests now convert to an upstream request for the entire resource, to
    populate the cache.
    Surprising behavior change may result if there are any active filters upstream
    of a CacheFilter, including if RouteConfiguration does any actions
    (e.g. adding headers) - it is recommended that for anything other than the most
    simplistic configuration (for which the CacheFilter should be the furthest
    upstream filter), a CacheFilter should be configured to make its requests
    to an InternalListener which duplicates the RouteConfiguration and any filter
    chain upstream of the CacheFilter. This is recognized as far from ideal.
