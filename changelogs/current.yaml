- area: ext_proc
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Closing the gRPC stream if Envoy detects no more external processing needed.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_proc_stream_close_optimization`` to ``false``.

    Fix a crash in the TCP connection pool that occurs during downstream connection teardown when large requests
    or responses trigger flow control.
