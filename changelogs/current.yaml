- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.

- area: redis
  change: |
    Added zone-aware routing support for Redis Cluster proxy. New read policies
    :ref:`LOCAL_ZONE_AFFINITY <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.ConnPoolSettings.ReadPolicy.LOCAL_ZONE_AFFINITY>`
    and :ref:`LOCAL_ZONE_AFFINITY_REPLICAS_AND_PRIMARY <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.ConnPoolSettings.ReadPolicy.LOCAL_ZONE_AFFINITY_REPLICAS_AND_PRIMARY>`
    route read requests to replicas in the same availability zone. Zone discovery is enabled via
    :ref:`enable_zone_discovery <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.clusters.redis.v3.RedisClusterConfig.enable_zone_discovery>`.
    Note: This feature currently works with Valkey only.
