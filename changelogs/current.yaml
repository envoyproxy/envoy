  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27702) that caused ADS initialization
    to fail on the first attempt and set a back-off retry interval of up to 1 second, if ADS is
    using an Envoy Cluster for the backend. The issue was fixed to ensure that ADS initialization
    happens after the Envoy Cluster it depends upon has been properly initialized. ADS that does
    not depend on an Envoy Cluster (i.e. GoogleGrpc) is not affected by this change.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
