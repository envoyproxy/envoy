  change: |
    Added runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_proc_modified_append_default_value``.
    The default value of the runtime is kept as false to keep the legacy behavior. Stats counters and error logs are added if
    :ref:`append <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HeaderValueOption.append>` in
    :ref:`external processor service <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse>` is not explicitly encoded.
    These data will give us information whether it is safe to change the default value of ``append`` to be true.
