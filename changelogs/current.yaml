behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: http2
  change: |
    Sets runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to true by default.
- area: dfp
  change: |
    Setting :ref:`dns_query_timeout
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_query_timeout>`
    to 0 will disable the the Envoy DNS query timeout and use the underlying DNS implementation timeout.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: dfp
  change:
    Fixes a bug when loading a DNS cache entry with an empty authority/host header. This fix can be reverted by setting
    runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.dfp_fail_on_empty_host_header`` to ``false``.
- area: router
  change: |
    Fixed query parameter matcher to properly implement
    :ref:`present_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.QueryParameterMatcher.present_match>`. Previously, the
    matcher would incorrectly handle ``present_match`` configurations by treating them as default present checks. This
    behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime feature
    ``envoy_reloadable_features_enable_new_query_param_present_match_behavior`` to ``false``.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change:
    Fixes a bug when TCP is tunneled over HTTP and upstream connection closed before response headers received to the stream.
    The fix is to run the retry logic in a different event loop iteration to allow cleanup of the closed connection before retrying.
    This fix can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.tcp_proxy_retry_on_different_event_loop`` to ``false``.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed OAuth2 credential injector to send scope (if specified) to authorization server when requesting new access
    token using ``client_credentials`` flow.

    Removed runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.dns_details`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Add the option to specify SameSite cookie attribute values for oauth2 supported cookies.
    To specify ``SameSite`` attribute, choose one of the values from ``strict``, ``lax`` or ``none``. If not specified,
    a default value of ``disabled`` will be assigned and there will be no ``SameSite`` value in the cookie attribute. See
    :ref:`apply_on_stream_done <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.cookie_configs>`
    for more details.
- area: spiffe
  change: |
    Added :ref:`trust_bundles
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SPIFFECertValidatorConfig.trust_bundles>`
    to the SPIFFE certificate validator configuration. This field allows specifying a SPIFFE trust
    bundle mapping as a ``DataSource``. If both ``trust_bundles`` and ``trust_domains`` are specified,
    ``trust_bundles`` takes precedence.
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    Added support to monitor container CPU utilization in Linux K8s environment using
    :ref:`existing extension <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.cpu_utilization.v3.CpuUtilizationConfig>`.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added :ref:`virtualClusterName() <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_virtual_cluster_name>` API to the Stream Info
    Object to get the name of the virtual cluster matched.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added an UDP extension for tap custom sink.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support for outlier detection in UDP proxy. This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_udp_proxy_outlier_detection`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added alpha support for asynchronous load balancing. See
    :ref:`load balancing policies overview <arch_overview_load_balancing_policies>` for more details. Support can
    be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.async_host_selection`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Adding support for a new body mode: ``FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`` in the ``ext_proc`` filter
    :ref:`processing_mode <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.processing_mode>`.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added ``QUERY_PARAM`` support for substitution formatter. See :ref:`access log formatter <config_access_log_format>`
    for more details.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`max_metadata_size <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_metadata_size>` to make
    HTTP/2 metadata limits configurable.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`backoff_options <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.backoff_options>`
    to configure the backoff strategy for TCP proxy retries.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for multi-key commands on transactions.
- area: dfp
  change: |
    Added a feature to disable DNS refresh on failure by setting :ref:`disable_dns_refresh_on_failure
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.disable_dns_refresh_on_failure>` to
    ``true``. By enabling this feature, the failed hosts will now be treated as a cache miss.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Reporting a locality_stats to LRS server when ``rq_issued > 0``, disable by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.report_load_with_rq_issued`` to ``false``.
