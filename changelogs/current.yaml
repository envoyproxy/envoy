- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed upstream client to not close connection when idle timeout fires before the connection is established.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.codec_client_enable_idle_timer_only_when_connected`` to ``false``.

new_features:
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added support for TLS session ticket resumption in QUIC using configured session ticket keys from
    :ref:`session_ticket_keys <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.DownstreamTlsContext.session_ticket_keys>`.
    This enables faster reconnection across server instances by allowing clients to resume TLS sessions
    without full handshakes. The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_session_ticket_support`` to ``true``.
