- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed OAuth2 refresh requests so host rewriting no longer overrides the original ``Host`` header value.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where headers from a denied authorization response (non-200) were not properly propagated
    to the client.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed the HTTP ext_authz client to respect ``status_on_error`` configuration when the authorization
    server returns a 5xx error or when HTTP call failures occur. Previously, these error scenarios always
    returned 403 Forbidden regardless of the configured error status.
