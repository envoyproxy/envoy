behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: thread_local
  change: |
    Changes the behavior of the ``SlotImpl`` class destructor. With this change the destructor can be called on any thread.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_slot_destroy_on_worker_threads``
    to false.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Changes the default value of ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to true. This changes the codec used for HTTP/2
    requests and responses. This behavior can be reverted by setting the feature to false.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: tracers
  change: |
    Set status code for OpenTelemetry tracers (previously unset).
- area: xds
  change: |
    Updated xDS-TP path naming to better comply with RFC-3986. Encoded resource paths can now include an a colon ``:``,
    instead of ``%3A``. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.xdstp_path_avoid_colon_encoding`` to ``false``.
- area: udp
  change: |
    Change GRO read buffer to 64kB to avoid MSG_TRUNC. And change the way to limit the number of packets processed per event
    loop to work with GRO. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.udp_socket_apply_aggregated_read_limit`` to false.
- area: statistics
  change: |
    Hot restart statistics like hot_restart_epoch are only set when hot restart is enabled.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Changes the behavior of the getaddrinfo DNS resolver so that it treats EAI_NODATA and EAI_NONAME
    as successful queries with empty results, instead of as DNS failures. This change brings the
    getaddrinfo behavior in-line with the c-ares resolver behavior. This behavior can be reverted by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.dns_nodata_noname_is_success`` to false.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: outlier detection
  change: |
    Fixed :ref:`successful_active_health_check_uneject_host
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.OutlierDetection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host>`.
    Before, a failed health check could uneject the host if the ``FAILED_ACTIVE_HC`` health flag had not been set.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix a RELEASE_ASSERT when using :ref:`auto_sni <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.UpstreamHttpProtocolOptions.auto_sni>`
    if the downstream request ``:authority`` was longer than 255 characters.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added field
    :ref:`validate_mutations <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.validate_mutations>`,
    which, when set to true, adds header & query parameter mutation validation to the http ext_authz
    filter. If an authz response contains invalid mutations, the filter responds to the downstream
    request with HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. If you use ext_authz with an untrusted side stream,
    it's recommended you set this to true.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fix a crash when reloading the HTTP Connection Manager via ECDS.
- area: cares
  change: |
    Upgraded c-ares library to 1.20.1 and added fix to c-ares DNS implementation to additionally check for ``ARES_EREFUSED``,
    ``ARES_ESERVFAIL``and ``ARES_ENOTIMP`` status. Without this fix, ``DestroyChannelOnRefused`` and
    ``CustomResolverValidAfterChannelDestruction`` unit test will break.
- area: udp
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that would cause Envoy to crash when updates to a pre-existing cluster were made (e.g. ``HostSet`` changes).
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Handle ``append_action`` from :ref:`external authorization service <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.auth.v3.CheckResponse>`
    that was ignored.

new_features:
- area: matching
  change: |
    Added :ref:`Filter State Input <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.matching.common_inputs.network.v3.FilterStateInput>`
    for matching http input based on filter state objects.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added support for QUIC server preferred address when there is a DNAT between the client and Envoy. See
    :ref:`new config
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.quic.server_preferred_address.v3.FixedServerPreferredAddressConfig.AddressFamilyConfig.dnat_address>`.
- area: cares
  change: |
    Added :ref:`udp_max_queries<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.cares.v3.CaresDnsResolverConfig.udp_max_queries>`
    option to limit the number of UDP queries.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`disable_shadow_host_suffix_append
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.disable_shadow_host_suffix_append>`
    in :ref:`request_mirror_policies <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.request_mirror_policies>`
    for disabling appending of the ``-shadow`` suffix to the shadowed host/authority header.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for `inline commands <https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#inline-commands>`_.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Added :ref:`delay_deny <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.rbac.v3.RBAC>` to support deny connection after
    the configured duration.

deprecated:
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Disable OpenCensus by default, as it is
    `no longer supported/maintained upstream <https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2023/sunsetting-opencensus/>`_.
    This extension can be replaced with the OpenTelemetry tracer and collector.
