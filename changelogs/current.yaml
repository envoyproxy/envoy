behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: eds
  change: |
    Introduced caching of EDS assignments when used with ADS. Prior to this change, Envoy required that EDS assignments were sent
    after an EDS cluster was updated. If no EDS assignment was received for the cluster, it ended up with an empty assignment.
    Following this change, after a cluster update, Envoy waits for an EDS assignment until
    :ref:`initial_fetch_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.initial_fetch_timeout>` times out, and will then apply
    the cached assignment and finish updating the warmed cluster. This change is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting
    the runtime flag ``envoy.restart_features.use_eds_cache_for_ads`` to true.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: outlier detection
  change: |
    Outlier detection will always respect max_ejection_percent now.
    This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.check_mep_on_first_eject`` to false.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Enable QUICHE request and response headers validation. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.FLAGS_envoy_quic_reloadable_flag_quic_act_upon_invalid_header`` to false.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: connection limit
  change: |
    fixed a use-after-free bug in the connection limit filter.
- area: subset load balancer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where
    :ref:`overprovisioning_factor<envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment.Policy.overprovisioning_factor>` and
    :ref:`weighted_priority_health <envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment.Policy.weighted_priority_health>`
    values were not respected when subset load balacing was enabled. The default values of 140 and false were always used.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added %RESPONSE_FLAGS_LONG% substitution string, that will output a pascal case string representing the resonse flags.
    The output response flags will correspond with %RESPONSE_FLAGS%, only with a long textual string representation.
- area: config
  change: |
    Added the capability to defer broadcasting of certain cluster (CDS, EDS) to
    worker threads from the main thread. This optimization can save significant
    amount of memory in cases where there are (1) a large number of workers and
    (2) a large amount of config, most of which is unused. This capability is
    guarded by :ref:`enable_deferred_cluster_creation
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.ClusterManager.enable_deferred_cluster_creation>`.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added ECDS support for :ref:` downstream network filters<envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Filter.config_discovery>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    added :ref:`Json-To-Metadata filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.json_to_metadata.v3.JsonToMetadata>`.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added metric listener.listener_stat.network_extension_config_missing to track closed connections due to missing config.
- area: redis
  change: |
    added support for time command (returns a local response).
- area: redis
  change: |
    added support for lmove command.
