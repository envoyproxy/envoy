- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: http2
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Envoy will leak memory if the HTTP2 stream is reset before the request headers are
    sent. For example, if one upstream http filter send a local reply after the connection is established but
    before the request headers are sent, the memory allocated for the stream will not be released.
