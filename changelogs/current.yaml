behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    The TCP proxy filter now requires :ref:`max_early_data_bytes
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.max_early_data_bytes>` to be
    explicitly set when using :ref:`upstream_connect_mode
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.upstream_connect_mode>` modes
    other than ``IMMEDIATE`` (i.e., ``ON_DOWNSTREAM_DATA`` or ``ON_DOWNSTREAM_TLS_HANDSHAKE``). The field
    can be set to ``0`` to disable early data buffering while still using delayed connection modes.
    Configurations using these modes without ``max_early_data_bytes`` will now fail validation at startup.
- area: on_demand
  change: |
    The on_demand filter, when doing On Demand CDS, will no longer do internal redirects after CDS is
    successful. Filters appearing in the filter chain before the On Demand Filter will no longer be
    invoked twice. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.on_demand_cluster_no_recreate_stream`` to ``false``.
- area: boringssl/fips
  change: |
    The previous flag for specifying FIPS builds (ie ``--define=boringssl=fips``) will no longer work and
    has been replaced by ``--config=boringssl-fips``. This change will allow us to better support custom
    SSL libraries, and will allow FIPS-compliant Envoy to be built with the imminent switch to Bazel bzlmod.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: mcp
  change: |
    Changed the default metadata namespace for the MCP filter from ``mcp_proxy`` to ``envoy.filters.http.mcp``.
    This change can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.mcp_filter_use_new_metadata_namespace`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Changed the behavior of ``timeout: 0s`` in the HTTP ext_authz filter to mean "no timeout" (infinite)
    instead of immediate timeout. Previously, ``timeout: 0s`` would cause requests to fail immediately.
    This aligns with other Envoy timeout configurations where ``0`` means disabled or infinite.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Changed the behavior of ``timeout: 0s`` in the HTTP rate limit filter to mean "no timeout" (infinite)
    instead of immediate timeout. Previously, ``timeout: 0s`` would cause requests to fail immediately.
    This aligns with other Envoy timeout configurations where ``0`` means disabled or infinite.
- area: histograms
  change: |
    Updated libcircllhist to 0.3.2, which changes how bucket bounds are interpreted. This should not impact
    production monitoring if the number of samples in the histograms is high. Affected tests were adjusted
    to account for histogram changes.
- area: stat_sinks
  change: |
    OpenTelemetry :ref:`SinkConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.stat_sinks.open_telemetry.v3.SinkConfig>`
    stopped reporting empty delta counters and histograms.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix on-demand TLS selector to enforce session resumption settings.
- area: load_report
  change: |
    Fixed an issue upon load-report shutdown race with ADS stream. Introduced proper cleanup of the gRPC stream.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec
    completion) would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was
    sent before the request was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This change
    can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.
- area: overload_manager
  change: |
    Fixed a resource leak in global connection limit tracking that caused permanent connection rejections
    when using load shedding (e.g., ``envoy.load_shed_points.tcp_listener_accept``). When connections were
    rejected due to load shedding after passing the global connection limit check, the allocated connection
    limit resource was not released, causing the connection counter to become incorrect and leading to
    ``failed_updates`` in the resource monitor. This resulted in permanent connection rejections even after
    load subsided. The fix ensures that connection limit resources are properly released when connections
    are rejected due to load shedding. Also added defensive resource cleanup for edge cases where address
    processing fails (e.g., ``localAddress()`` or ``peerAddress()`` errors).
- area: drop_overload
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where ``drop_overload`` failed to use cached EDS resources.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed upstream client to not close connection when idle timeout fires before the connection is
    established. This change can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.codec_client_enable_idle_timer_only_when_connected`` to ``false``.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed OAuth2 refresh requests so host rewriting no longer overrides the original ``Host`` header value.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where headers from a denied authorization response (non-200) were not properly propagated
    to the client.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Fixed the log formatter in HTTP router upstream logs by correctly setting the downstream connection's
    ``ConnectionInfoProvider`` in the ``StreamInfo``.
- area: spiffe
  change: |
    Reduce the number of the file watches needed by :ref:`trust_bundles
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SPIFFECertValidatorConfig.trust_bundles>` when the validator
    is used in multiple places. Add support for :ref:`watched_directory
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.datasource.watched_directory>` to support Kubernetes environments that rely on
    atomic symbolic file updates.  Add content hashing during file watching to handle excessive watch notifications.
- area: odcds
  change: |
    Fixed a crash (SIGABRT) when destroying OdCDS handles on worker threads. The handle no longer holds
    a direct reference to the subscription, preventing thread-safety issues during destruction. The
    subscription now persists in ClusterManagerImpl and is looked up by a config source key.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed the HTTP ext_authz client to respect ``status_on_error`` configuration when the authorization
    server returns a 5xx error or when HTTP call failures occur. Previously, these error scenarios always
    returned 403 Forbidden regardless of the configured error status.
- area: release
  change: |
    Published contrib binaries now include the ``-contrib`` suffix in their version string.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: composite filter
  change: |
    Added support for configuring a chain of filters in the composite filter's :ref:`ExecuteFilterAction
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.composite.v3.ExecuteFilterAction>` via the ``filter_chain`` field.
- area: server
  change: |
    Add new command-line option ``--file-flush-min-size-kb <integer>`` to configure the minimum size in kilobytes for log file flushing.
- area: network_filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`geoip network filter <config_network_filters_geoip>` to perform geolocation lookups
    at the network layer and store results in filter state. This enables geolocation data to be
    used for access logging, routing, and other purposes without requiring HTTP traffic.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added support for configuring cookie path in the OAuth2 filter. The :ref:`path
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.CookieConfig.path>` field can now be set
    for each cookie type to control the scope of OAuth2 cookies.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Added support for loading dynamic modules globally by setting :ref:`load_globally
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig.load_globally>` to ``true``.
- area: http filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`transform http filter <config_http_filters_transform>` to modify request and response bodies in any
    position of the HTTP filter chain. This also makes it possible to refresh routes based on attributes in the request
    body.
- area: matcher
  change: |
    Removed work-in-progress annotations from RBAC filter ``matcher`` and ``shadow_matcher`` fields in HTTP and network
    filters, marking the feature stable.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added process-level rate limiting on access log emission via
    :ref:`ProcessRateLimitFilter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.access_loggers.filters.process_ratelimit.v3.ProcessRateLimitFilter>`.
- area: listener_filters
  change: |
    Added :ref:`Postgres Inspector <config_listener_filters_postgres_inspector>` listener filter for detecting
    PostgreSQL connections, extracting metadata, and supporting SNI-based routing for PostgreSQL traffic.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Enhanced dynamic module ABIs to support header addition and body size retrieval. See the latest ABI header for
    details.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Added support for streamable HTTP callouts in dynamic modules. Modules can create streaming HTTP connections to
    upstream clusters using ``start_http_stream``, send request data and trailers incrementally, and receive streaming
    response headers, data, and trailers through dedicated callbacks.
- area: udp_sink
  change: |
    Enhanced the UDP sink to support tapped messages larger than 64KB.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Marked :ref:`filter_chain_matcher <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.filter_chain_matcher>` as stable
    by removing the work-in-progress annotation. The xDS matcher API for filter chain selection has been thoroughly
    tested and is ready for production use.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added a new :ref:`access logger <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.access_loggers.stats.v3.Config>` that emits
    configurable metrics.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Fixed ``start_time_unix_nano`` for exported metrics.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Added support for dropping stats via
    :ref:`DropAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.stat_sinks.open_telemetry.v3.SinkConfig.DropAction>` during
    custom metric conversion.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`error_response <envoy_v3_api_field_service.auth.v3.CheckResponse.error_response>` in the
    external authorization API. Authorization services can return custom HTTP status codes, headers, and response bodies
    on internal errors, reusing :ref:`DeniedHttpResponse <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.auth.v3.DeniedHttpResponse>`.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added :ref:`upstream_connect_mode
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.upstream_connect_mode>`
    and :ref:`max_early_data_bytes
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.max_early_data_bytes>`
    to control when upstream connections are established and early data buffering behavior.
    This enables use cases like extracting TLS certificate information or SNI before establishing
    upstream connections.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`vhost_header <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteConfiguration.vhost_header>` to
    :ref:`RouteConfiguration <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteConfiguration>` to allow using a different header
    for vhost matching.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Added a parameter to ``sendGoAwayAndClose`` to support graceful closure of HTTP/2 connections.
- area: logging
  change: |
    Added support for the not-equal operator in access log filter rules via
    :ref:`ComparisonFilter <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.accesslog.v3.ComparisonFilter>`.
- area: c-ares
  change: |
    Added optional ``reinit_channel_on_timeout`` to the c-ares resolver to reinitialize the channel after DNS timeouts.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Added per-expression configuration options for the CEL evaluator to control string conversion, concatenation, and
    string extension functions. CEL expressions in RBAC policies and access log filters can enable functions such as
    ``replace()`` and ``split()`` through new :ref:`cel_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.rbac.v3.Policy.cel_config>` and
    :ref:`cel_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.access_loggers.filters.cel.v3.ExpressionFilter.cel_config>` fields.
    See :ref:`CelExpressionConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.CelExpressionConfig>` for details.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added support for the following new access log formatters:

    #. ``%REQUEST_HEADER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%REQ(X?Y):Z%``.
    #. ``%RESPONSE_HEADER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%RESP(X?Y):Z%``.
    #. ``%RESPONSE_TRAILER(X?Y):Z%`` as full name version of ``%TRAILER(X?Y):Z%``.

    This provides a more consistent naming scheme for users to understand and use.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added new :ref:`value <envoy_v3_api_field_type.tracing.v3.CustomTag.value>` field and support for
    :ref:`substitution format specifier <config_access_log_format>` to extract values from request and response data for
    custom tags.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added new :ref:`tracing operation
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.operation>`
    and :ref:`upstream tracing operation
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.upstream_operation>`
    fields in the tracing configuration to set custom operation names for spans with the
    substitution format specifier.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    Added custom substitution format specifier support in tracing custom tags for the
    :ref:`generic_proxy filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.v3.GenericProxy>`. The
    ``%REQUEST_PROPERTY%`` and ``%RESPONSE_PROPERTY%`` specifiers can now be used in
    :ref:`value <envoy_v3_api_field_type.tracing.v3.CustomTag.value>` for generic proxy.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``drainConnectionUponCompletion()`` to the Lua filter stream info API, allowing Lua scripts to mark
    connections for draining (adds ``Connection: close`` for HTTP/1.1 or sends ``GOAWAY`` for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3).
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added an executions counter to the Lua filter to track script execution count.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Added ``sign`` foreign function to create cryptographic signatures. See :ref:`Wasm foreign functions
    <arch_overview_wasm_foreign_functions>` for details.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Moved the implementation of KEYS,SELECT,ROLE to the cluster scope command framework.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    The fixed heap resource monitor can calculate memory pressure as currently allocated memory divided by maximum heap
    size, providing more accurate and lower pressure values. This can avoid unnecessary load shedding. Enable via
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.fixed_heap_use_allocated``. The default algorithm (heap_size - pageheap_unmapped -
    pageheap_free) does not discount free memory in TCMalloc caches.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added :ref:`transport_socket_matcher
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.transport_socket_matcher>` to clusters. This matcher
    uses the generic xDS matcher framework to select a named transport socket from
    :ref:`transport_socket_matches
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.transport_socket_matches>` based on endpoint metadata,
    locality metadata, and transport socket filter state.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Added ``/memory/tcmalloc`` admin endpoint providing TCMalloc memory statistics.
- area: dns_filter
  change: |
    Added :ref:`access_log <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3.DnsFilterConfig.access_log>` for the
    DNS filter.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added support for substitution formatting in rate limit descriptor values.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for ``redis_proxy`` to use separate credentials for each upstream Redis cluster.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added QUIC protocol option :ref:`max_sessions_per_event_loop
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.QuicProtocolOptions.max_sessions_per_event_loop>` to limit the maximum
    number of new QUIC sessions created per event loop. The default is 16, preserving the previous hardcoded limit.
- area: metrics_service
  change: |
    Added :ref:`batch_size <envoy_v3_api_field_config.metrics.v3.MetricsServiceConfig.batch_size>` to the Metrics
    Service to batch metrics into multiple gRPC messages. When positive, metrics are batched with at most ``batch_size``
    metric families per message to avoid gRPC size limits. If unset or 0, all metrics are sent in one message.
- area: network
  change: |
    Started populating filter state ``envoy.network.network_namespace`` when a connection is accepted on a listener with
    :ref:`network_namespace_filepath <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SocketAddress.network_namespace_filepath>`
    configured, providing read-only access to the network namespace for filters, access logs, and other components.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added configuration field
    :ref:`enforce_response_header_limits <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.enforce_response_header_limits>`
    to the HTTP ext_authz filter to enable or disable dropping response headers once header count or size limits are
    reached.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Added runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.report_load_when_rq_active_is_non_zero``. When enabled, LRS
    continues to send ``locality_stats`` reports to the config server even when no requests were issued in the poll
    cycle.
- area: on_demand
  change: |
    Added runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.on_demand_track_end_stream``. When enabled, the on_demand filter
    tracks downstream ``end_stream`` state to support stream recreation with fully read request bodies. Previously, the
    filter rejected all requests with bodies by checking only for a decoding buffer.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`request_mirror_policies <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.request_mirror_policies>`
    to :ref:`HttpProtocolOptions <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions>` for cluster-level
    request mirroring. Cluster-level policies override route-level policies when both are configured.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`retry_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.retry_policy>` to
    :ref:`HttpProtocolOptions <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions>` for cluster-level
    retry policies.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`hash_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.hash_policy>` to
    :ref:`HttpProtocolOptions <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions>` for cluster-level
    hash policies.
- area: network
  change: |
    Added logging info for network ext_proc to filter state.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added an extension to override the :ref:`upstream bind address Linux network namespace
    <extension_envoy.upstream.local_address_selector.filter_state_override>` using a shared filter state object.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added ``US_RX_BODY_BEG`` time point to ``%COMMON_DURATION%`` to indicate when upstream response body reception
    begins.
- area: outlier_detection
  change: |
    Added :ref:`detect_degraded_hosts <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.OutlierDetection.detect_degraded_hosts>`
    to enable passive degraded host detection. When enabled, outlier detection marks hosts as degraded when they return
    the ``x-envoy-degraded`` header. Degraded hosts are deprioritized in load balancing but remain in rotation (not
    ejected). The degraded state is cleared using the same backoff algorithm as ejection. Defaults to false.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    The :ref:`MappedAttributeBuilder
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.ext_proc.processing_request_modifiers.mapped_attribute_builder.v3.MappedAttributeBuilder>`
    ext_proc extension now supports re-mapping response attributes (in addition to request attributes).
- area: router
  change: |
    Added substitution formatting for direct response bodies via
    :ref:`body_format <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.DirectResponseAction.body_format>` in
    :ref:`DirectResponseAction <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.DirectResponseAction>`.
- area: tls_inspector
  change: |
    Propagated transport errors from tls_inspector to ``DownstreamTransportFailureReason`` in ``StreamInfo`` for access logging
    prior to the TLS handshake.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Added support for MaxMind Country database via
    :ref:`country_db_path <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.geoip_providers.maxmind.v3.MaxMindConfig.country_db_path>`.
- area: tls_inspector
  change: |
    Added configuration parameter to TLS inspector for maximum acceptable client hello size.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Enhanced TLS certificate validation failure messages in access logs to include detailed error information.
    The ``%DOWNSTREAM_TRANSPORT_FAILURE_REASON%`` and ``%UPSTREAM_TRANSPORT_FAILURE_REASON%`` access log
    formatters now include specific validation failure reasons such as ``verify cert failed: SAN matcher``,
    ``verify cert failed: cert hash and spki``, or the OpenSSL verification error string (e.g., certificate
    has expired, unable to get local issuer certificate). This provides better visibility into TLS handshake
    failures without requiring debug-level logging.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added support for forwarding cluster metadata to ext_proc server.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Added ``match_included_headers`` to the request signing extension to allow positive header matching while excluding
    other non-SigV4-required headers.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Added :ref:`custom_header_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.geoip.v3.Geoip.custom_header_config>`
    to allow extracting the client IP address from a custom request header which can be used instead of
    ``x-forwarded-for`` header or downstream connection source address.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`metadata_context_namespaces
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.metadata_context_namespaces>` and
    :ref:`typed_metadata_context_namespaces
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.typed_metadata_context_namespaces>` in the
    ext-authz network filter. This allows passing connection metadata (such as proxy protocol TLV data) to the
    external authorization server for making authorization decisions.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added support for fetching certificates on-demand via SDS in the downstream TLS transport socket
    using the extension :ref:`on-demand certificate selector
    <extension_envoy.tls.certificate_selectors.on_demand_secret>`.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Added :ref:`allow_paths <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Admin.allow_paths>` to admin
    interface to restrict access to specific admin endpoints. When configured, only paths matching
    the specified string matchers will be accessible. All other paths will return 403 Forbidden.
- area: attributes
  change: |
    Added :ref:`attributes <arch_overview_attributes>` for looking up request or response header bytes.
- area: json_to_metadata
  change: |
    Added support for per-route configuration override in the ``json_to_metadata`` http filter. Routes can now
    specify different JSON to metadata conversion rules via per-route configuration, allowing different routes
    to extract different metadata from request or response bodies.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Dynatrace sampler parses and propagates trace capture reason in tracestate.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Added :ref:`tlv_location <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.listener.proxy_protocol.v3.ProxyProtocol.tlv_location>`
    configuration field to control where proxy protocol TLV values are stored. When set to ``FILTER_STATE``, TLV values
    are stored in a single filter state object with key ``envoy.network.proxy_protocol.tlv``, enabling HTTP filters to
    access TLV values via FilterStateInput without requiring custom HTTP filters to copy metadata. Individual TLV values
    can be accessed via field access: ``%FILTER_STATE(envoy.network.proxy_protocol.tlv:FIELD:key)%``. Defaults to
    ``DYNAMIC_METADATA`` to maintain existing behavior.
- area: mcp
  change: |
    Added :ref:`MCP filter <config_http_filters_mcp>` for parsing Model Context Protocol (MCP) JSON-RPC requests.
    The filter extracts the ``method`` and ``id`` fields from incoming requests and stores them in dynamic metadata
    for use by downstream filters and access logging. Notifications (methods starting with ``notifications/``) are
    correctly handled as they don't have an ``id`` field per the JSON-RPC specification.
- area: mcp
  change: |
    Added :ref:`mcp_router HTTP filter <config_http_filters_mcp_router>` which routes MCP (Model Context Protocol)
    requests to more backend servers. The filter supports fanout to multiple backends for initialize and tools-list requests,
    single-backend routing for tools-call based on tool name prefix, session management with composite session IDs,
    and response aggregation.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added ``LISTENER_FILTER_CHAIN`` to the ``METADATA`` command operator to allow access to listener filter chain metadata.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added per HTTP event :ref:'procesing effects <envoy.filters.http.ext_proc.ProcessingEffect' in the
    ExtProcLoggingInfo in the FilterState. This new data will be automatically collected and can be accesses via
    method processingEffects.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added support for additional parameters in the OAuth2 token request body via
    :ref:`endpoint_params <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.http.injected_credentials.oauth2.v3.OAuth2.endpoint_params>`.
    This allows passing custom parameters required by authorization servers (such as Logto or EntraID) that expect
    additional body parameters during the token exchange.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for the ``append_action`` enum in gRPC ext_authz ``OkHttpResponse.headers`` for upstream
    request header mutations. Previously, only the deprecated ``append`` boolean was checked. Now
    ``APPEND_IF_EXISTS_OR_ADD``, ``ADD_IF_ABSENT``, ``OVERWRITE_IF_EXISTS``, and ``OVERWRITE_IF_EXISTS_OR_ADD``
    actions are fully supported, providing parity with ``response_headers_to_add`` handling.
- area: stats
  change: |
    Added support to limit the number of stats stored in each stats scope in the stats library.
- area: stats
  change: |
    The admin prometheus stats endpoint now supports the protobuf exposition format, and will automatically
    use it if the request contains the correct Accept header, or if query parameter ``prom_protobuf=1`` is
    set. In a prometheus scrape configuration, add ``PrometheusProto`` to ``scrape_protocols`` to use
    the protobuf format.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added support for fetching certificates on-demand via SDS in the upstream TLS transport socket
    using the extension :ref:`on-demand certificate selector
    <extension_envoy.tls.certificate_selectors.on_demand_secret>`.
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    Introduced the extended ABI forward compatibility mechanism for dynamic modules
    where modules built with a SDK version can be loaded by Envoy
    binaries of the next Envoy version. For example, A module built with the v1.38 SDK
    can now be loaded by an Envoy binary of v1.39.
- area: mcp_router
  change: |
    Added support for MCP resource methods ``resources/list``, ``resources/read``,
    ``resources/subscribe``, and ``resources/unsubscribe``.
- area: mcp_router
  change: |
    Added support for MCP prompt methods ``prompts/list`` and ``prompts/get``.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added per-descriptor ``x-ratelimit-*`` headers support. See the
    :ref:`x_ratelimit_option <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RateLimit.x_ratelimit_option>`
    field documentation for more details.
- area: mcp_router
  change: |
    Added support for MCP client-to-server notification methods ``notifications/cancelled``
    and ``notifications/roots/list_changed``.
- area: mcp_router
  change: |
    Added support for MCP completion method ``completion/complete`` with routing based on
    ``ref/prompt`` or ``ref/resource``.
- area: mcp_router
  change: |
    Added support for MCP logging method ``logging/setLevel``.
- area: network
  change: |
    Added support access logging in network filters like http filters, by allowing network filters to register as access logger
    instances.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Extended ``*_WITHOUT_PORT`` address formatters to accept an optional ``MASK_PREFIX_LEN`` parameter
    that masks IP addresses and returns them in CIDR notation (e.g., ``%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT(16)%``
    returns ``10.1.0.0/16`` for client IP ``10.1.10.23``).
- area: stat_sinks
  change: |
    Added support for exporting OpenTelemetry metrics via HTTP. The new ``http_service`` field
    in :ref:`SinkConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.stat_sinks.open_telemetry.v3.SinkConfig>`
    enables direct OTLP metrics export to backends that only accept HTTP (Dynatrace, Datadog, Elastic),
    without requiring an intermediate collector sidecar.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added support for shadow mode in the local rate limit filter.
- area: config
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`set_node_on_first_message_only
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ApiConfigSource.set_node_on_first_message_only>` to Delta-xDS.
    Guarded by runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.xds_legacy_delta_skip_subsequent_node``.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added the new access log formatter ``DOWNSTREAM_LOCAL_CLOSE_REASON``.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added ``%UPSTREAM_DETECTED_CLOSE_TYPE%`` and ``%DOWNSTREAM_DETECTED_CLOSE_TYPE%`` to expose the detected
    close type of downstream and upstream connections. The possible values are ``Normal``, ``LocalReset``,
    and ``RemoteReset``.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added an option to emit a log entry when the connection is accepted.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added :ref:`load balancing policies
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModulesLoadBalancerConfig>`
    support for dynamic modules, enabling custom load balancing algorithms to be implemented in dynamic modules.
- area: sse_parser
  change: |
    Extended the SSE parser utility to support all standard SSE fields: ``id``, ``event`` (as ``event_type``),
    and ``retry``, in addition to the existing ``data`` field. The ``retry`` field is parsed as a ``uint32_t``
    and only accepts values consisting of ASCII digits per the SSE specification.
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    Added cgroup v2 support to the CPU utilization resource monitor. The monitor now automatically
    detects and selects between cgroup v1 and v2 at runtime by checking available cgroup files on
    the system. This enables the resource monitor to work correctly in both cgroup v1 and v2
    environments without configuration changes.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added configurable :ref:`metrics_namespace
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleConfig.metrics_namespace>` field
    to ``DynamicModuleConfig``. This allows users to customize the prefix used for all metrics
    created by dynamic modules. Metrics now appear with the standard ``envoy_`` prefix followed by
    the namespace in prometheus output (e.g. ``envoy_myapp_requests_total``). The legacy behavior
    (stripping the namespace prefix from prometheus output) can be restored by setting the runtime
    guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.dynamic_modules_strip_custom_stat_prefix`` to ``true``.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added a process-wide function registry to the dynamic modules ABI. Modules can register
    functions by name via ``envoy_dynamic_module_callback_register_function`` and other modules
    can resolve them via ``envoy_dynamic_module_callback_get_function``, enabling zero-copy
    cross-module interactions analogous to ``dlsym``.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added ``QUERY_PARAMS`` support for substitution formatter to log all query params.
    They can either be logged in their original form or decoded.
