behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: lua
  change: |
    When Lua script executes httpCall, backpressure is exercised when receiving body from downstream client. This behavior can be reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.lua_flow_control_while_http_call`` to false.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: dns
  change: |
    The DNS filter no longer returns FORMERR if a message has an ID of 0.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed fail-open behaviour of the :ref:`failure_mode_allow config option
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.failure_mode_allow>`
    when a grpc external authz server is used.
    The behaviour can be enabled by ``envoy_reloadable_features_process_ext_authz_grpc_error_codes_as_errors``.
