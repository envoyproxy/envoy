- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.

new_features:
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    Added cgroup v2 support to the CPU utilization resource monitor. The monitor now automatically
    detects and selects between cgroup v1 and v2 at runtime by checking available cgroup files on
    the system. This enables the resource monitor to work correctly in both cgroup v1 and v2
    environments without configuration changes.
