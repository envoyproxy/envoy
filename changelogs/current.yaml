behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    The TCP proxy filter now requires :ref:`max_early_data_bytes
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.max_early_data_bytes>` to be
    explicitly set when using :ref:`upstream_connect_mode
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.upstream_connect_mode>` modes
    other than ``IMMEDIATE`` (i.e., ``ON_DOWNSTREAM_DATA`` or ``ON_DOWNSTREAM_TLS_HANDSHAKE``). The field
    can be set to zero to disable early data buffering while still using delayed connection modes.
    Configurations using these modes without ``max_early_data_bytes`` will now fail validation at startup.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: histograms
  change: |
    Update of libcircllhist to 0.3.2 has changed how bucket bounds are interpreted. This should not have an impact on
    production monitoring if the number of samples in the histograms is high. Affected tests were adjusted to account for
    histogram changes.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a potential file descriptor leak where HTTP/1.1 connections with zombie streams (waiting for codec completion)
    would not be properly closed when in draining state. This could occur when a response was sent before the request
    was fully received, causing connections to remain open indefinitely. This behavior change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_close_connection_on_zombie_stream_complete`` to ``false``.
- area: drop_overload
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that drop_overload failed to use cached EDS resources.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed upstream client to not close connection when idle timeout fires before the connection is established.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.codec_client_enable_idle_timer_only_when_connected`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where headers from a denied authorization response (non-200s) were not properly propagated to the client.
