behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: thread_local
  change: |
    Changes the behavior of the ``SlotImpl`` class destructor. With this change the destructor can be called on any thread.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_slot_destroy_on_worker_threads``
    to false.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Adding support for
    :ref:`route_cache_action <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.route_cache_action>`.
    It specifies the route action to be taken when an external processor response is received in response to request headers.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Changes the default value of ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to true. This changes the codec used for HTTP/2
    requests and responses. This behavior can be reverted by setting the feature to false.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Added a "happy eyeballs" feature to HTTP/3 upstream, where it assuming happy eyeballs sorting results in alternating address
    families will attempt the first v4 and v6 address before giving up on HTTP/3.  This change can be reverted by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http3_happy_eyeballs`` to false.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Passes HTTP/2 DATA frames through a different codec API. This behavior can be temporarily disabled by setting the runtime
    feature ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_visitor_for_data`` to false.
- area: runtime
  change: |
    Rejecting invalid yaml. This has been an ENVOY_BUG linked to https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27434
    for over a year with no hard-blockers so should be Ok. This behavior can be temporarily disabled by setting
    the runtime feature ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_invalid_yaml`` to false but the runtime guard must be
    parsed before any invalid yaml.
- area: proxy_protocol
  change: |
    Populate typed metadata by default in proxy protocol listener. Typed metadata can be consumed as
    :ref:`TlvsMetadata type <envoy_v3_api_msg_data.core.v3.TlvsMetadata>`.
    This change can be temporarily disabled by setting the runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_typed_metadata_in_proxy_protocol_listener`` to ``false``.
- area: composite_filter
  change: |
    Adding support for
    :ref:`sample_percent <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.composite.v3.ExecuteFilterAction.sample_percent>`.
    It specifies the probability of the action execution. If not specified, it is 100%.
- area: golang
  change: |
    Move ``Continue``, ``SendLocalReply`` and ``RecoverPanic` from ``FilterCallbackHandler`` to ``DecoderFilterCallbacks`` and
    ``EncoderFilterCallbacks``, to support full-duplex processing.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Timeout errors in external processor now returns 504 Gateway Timeout to downstream clients.
    The previous behavior was returning 500 Internal Server Error.
- area: dfp
  change: |
    Changed dynamic forward proxy so local reply errors include DNS resolution details.  This behavior can be temporarily
    disabled by setting the runtime feature ``envoy.reloadable_features.dns_details`` to false.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Changes in ``AsyncStreamImpl`` and ``GoogleAsyncStreamImpl`` now propagate tracing context headers in bidirectional streams when using
    :ref:`Envoy gRPC client <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.GrpcService.envoy_grpc>` or
    :ref:`Google C++ gRPC client <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.GrpcService.google_grpc>`. Previously, tracing context headers
    were not being set when calling external services such as ``ext_proc``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed host header changes for shadow requests to properly handle ipv6 addresses.
- area: tracers
  change: |
    Set status code for OpenTelemetry tracers (previously unset).
- area: config
  change: |
    Stricter validation of a ``google.protobuf.Duration`` field in a config, rejecting invalid values (where the number
    of years is over 292). This can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.strict_duration_validation`` to ``false``.
- area: xds
  change: |
    Updated xDS-TP path naming to better comply with RFC-3986. Encoded resource paths can now include an a colon ``:``,
    instead of ``%3A``. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.xdstp_path_avoid_colon_encoding`` to ``false``.
- area: udp
  change: |
    Change GRO read buffer to 64kB to avoid MSG_TRUNC. And change the way to limit the number of packets processed per event
    loop to work with GRO. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.udp_socket_apply_aggregated_read_limit`` to false.
- area: statistics
  change: |
    Hot restart statistics like hot_restart_epoch are only set when hot restart is enabled.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Changes the behavior of the getaddrinfo DNS resolver so that it treats EAI_NODATA and EAI_NONAME
    as successful queries with empty results, instead of as DNS failures. This change brings the
    getaddrinfo behavior in-line with the c-ares resolver behavior. This behavior can be reverted by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.dns_nodata_noname_is_success`` to false.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    The upstream connection address, rather than the upstream host address, will be used for the ``%UPSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS%``,
    ``%UPSTREAM_REMOTE_PORT%`` and ``%UPSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT%`` access log format specifiers.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.upstream_remote_address_use_connection`` to false.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    The ``%CEL%`` formatter support call functions.
- area: http
  change: |
    Changing header validation checks in the substitution format utility and CEL code to do RCF complaint header validation.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.consistent_header_validation`` to false.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Cache source/destination address instances in a LUR cache for packet read to improve performance.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_upstream_socket_use_address_cache_for_read`` to false.
- area: quic
  change: |
    When a quic connection socket is created, the socket's detected transport protocol will be set to "quic".
- area: config
  change: |
    In xDS configuration, the :ref:`AUTO <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_config.core.v3.ApiVersion.AUTO>` value now means
    :ref:`V3 <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_config.core.v3.ApiVersion.V3>`. :ref:`AUTO <envoy_v3_api_enum_value_config.core.v3.ApiVersion.AUTO>`
    is the default value of the enum, so this field may be omitted from all configurations now.
- area: filters
  change: |
    Set ``WWW-Authenticate`` header for 401 responses from the Basic Auth filter.
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    jwt_authn now validates provider URIs. If the validation is too strict it can temporarily be
    disabled by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.jwt_authn_validate_uri`` to
    false.
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.refresh_rtt_after_request`` and legacy code path.
- area: http
  change: |
    Changing HTTP/2 semi-colon prefixed headers to being sanitized by Envoy code rather than nghttp2. Should be a functional no-op but
    guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_http2_headers_without_nghttp2``.
- area: http
  change: |
    http: envoy will now proxy 104 headers from upstream, though as with 100s only the first 1xx response
    headers will be sent.104 headers are designated by ietf's draft-ietf-httpbis-resumable-upload rfc.
    This behavioral can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.proxy_104`` to ``false``.
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    Changes the behavior of the
    :ref:`forward <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.jwt_authn.v3.JwtProvider.forward>`
    config. Previously, the config only removes JWT if set in headers. With this addition, the config can also be
    used to remove JWT set in query parameters. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.jwt_authn_remove_jwt_from_query_params`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    Reject messages with chunked transfer encoding with chunk extension containing CR not followed by LF. This can be temporarily reverted
    by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_balsa_disallow_lone_cr_in_chunk_extension`` to ``false``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: admission control
  change: |
    Fixed the thread-local controller's average RPS calculation to be calculated over the full
    lookback window. Previously, the controller would calculate the average RPS over the amount of
    time elapsed since the oldest valid request sample. This change brings the behavior in line with
    the documentation.
- area: outlier detection
  change: |
    Fixed :ref:`successful_active_health_check_uneject_host
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.OutlierDetection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host>`.
    Before, a failed health check could uneject the host if the ``FAILED_ACTIVE_HC`` health flag had not been set.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Applied 2 QUICHE patches for crash bugs in ``QuicSpdyStream`` ``OnDataAvailable()`` and ``OnInitialHeaderComplete()``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixed crash bug when QUIC downstream stream was read closed and then timed out.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fix a RELEASE_ASSERT when using :ref:`auto_sni <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.UpstreamHttpProtocolOptions.auto_sni>`
    if the downstream request ``:authority`` was longer than 255 characters.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fix an issue where span id is missing from opentelemetry access log entries.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added field
    :ref:`validate_mutations <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.validate_mutations>`,
    which, when set to true, adds header & query parameter mutation validation to the http ext_authz
    filter. If an authz response contains invalid mutations, the filter responds to the downstream
    request with HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. If you use ext_authz with an untrusted side stream,
    it's recommended you set this to true.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fix a crash when reloading the HTTP Connection Manager via ECDS.
- area: cares
  change: |
    Upgraded c-ares library to 1.20.1 and added fix to c-ares DNS implementation to additionally check for ``ARES_EREFUSED``,
    ``ARES_ESERVFAIL``and ``ARES_ENOTIMP`` status. Without this fix, ``DestroyChannelOnRefused`` and
    ``CustomResolverValidAfterChannelDestruction`` unit test will break.
- area: udp
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that would cause Envoy to crash when updates to a pre-existing cluster were made (e.g. ``HostSet`` changes).
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Handle ``append_action`` from :ref:`external authorization service <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.auth.v3.CheckResponse>`
    that was ignored.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that would cause Envoy to crash when recieving an Oauth callback while the Oauth upstream is unhealthy
    (e.g. due to DNS issues).
- area: http
  change: |
    Fix BalsaParser resetting state too early, guarded by default-true
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_balsa_delay_reset``.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Set the SNI value from the requested server name if it isn't available on the connection/socket. This applies when
    ``include_tls_session`` is true. The requested server name is set on a connection when filters such as the TLS
    inspector are used.
- area: oauth
  change: |
    The id token cookie now expires at the same time the id token itself expires, instead of when the access token expires.
- area: decompression
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where Envoy will go into an endless loop when using the brotli decompressor. If the input stream has
    redundant data, the decompressor will loop forever.
- area: websocket
  change: |
    Only 101 is considered a successful response for websocket handshake for HTTP/1.1, and Envoy as a proxy will proxy the response
    header from upstream to downstream and then close the request if other status is received. This behavior can be
    reverted by ``envoy_reloadable_features_check_switch_protocol_websocket_handshake``.
- area: async http client
  change: |
    Added one option to disable the response body buffering for mirror request. Also introduced a 32MB cap for the response
    buffer, which can be changed by the runtime flag ``http.async_response_buffer_limit`` based on the product needs.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Validate http service path_prefix
    :ref:`path_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.HttpService.path_prefix>`,
    Validate http service path_prefix configuration must start with ``/``.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the local rate limit filter would crash when the
    :ref:`enable_x_ratelimit_headers <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit>`
    is set to ``DRAFT_VERSION_03`` and a send local reply is triggered before the rate limit filter is executed.
- area: admin
  change: |
    Fixed missing :ref:`additional addresses <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.endpoint.v3.Endpoint.AdditionalAddress>`
    for :ref:`LbEndpoint <envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.LbEndpoint.endpoint>` in config dump.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where additional :ref:`cookie attributes <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.route.v3.RouteAction.HashPolicy.cookie>`
    are not sent properly to clients.
- area: datadog
  change: |
    Bumped the version of datadog to resolve a crashing bug in earlier versions of the library.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the user data will reference a dangling pointer to the Lua state and cause a crash.

    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_typed_subject_alt_names>`.
    An additional field ``oid`` is added to :ref:`SubjectAltNameMatcher
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SubjectAltNameMatcher>` to support this change.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added support for observability mode which deprecates ``async_mode``. If enabled, each part of the HTTP request or response
    specified by ProcessingMode is sent without waiting for the response from the ext_proc service. It is "Send and Go" mode
    that can be used by external processor to observe Envoy data and status.
- area: grpc
