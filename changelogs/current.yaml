behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: listener
  change: |
    Previously a listener update with different :ref:`transparent <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.transparent>`, :ref:`freebind <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.freebind>`,
    :ref:`tcp_fast_open_queue_length <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.tcp_fast_open_queue_length>` or :ref:`socket_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.socket_options>` was ignored.
    Now, when those fields are updated, a new socket will be created for
    the listener and the new value of those fields applied to it. This only happens when :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>` is true.
    Otherwise if those fields change the update is rejected.
    New runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_update_listener_socket_options`` can be used for revert this behavior.
- area: build
  change: |
    removed the cares and apple resolvers as required extensions. Envoy now only creates DNS resolvers when necessary (e.g. for logical DNS cluster) so does not require cares to always be included. If your Envoys do DNS resolution and you override extensions_build_config you will need to include cares explicitly.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Previously a listener update with different :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>` value will be ignored. Now,
    this kind of update will be rejected. The runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_update_listener_socket_options`` can be used for revert this behavior.
- area: build
  change: |
    moved the strict_dns, original_dst, logical_dns, static, and eds clusters to extensions. If you use these clusters and override extensions_build_config.bzl you will now need to include it explicitly.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: tls
  change: |
    added support for intermediate CA as trusted ca. The peer certificate issued by an intermediate CA will be trusted by
    building valid partial chain. In old days, it can not be verified without trusting its ancestor root CA and building
    a full chain.
    :ref:`trust_ca<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.trusted_ca>`.
    This change can be reverted via the ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_intermediate_ca``.

- area: cache_filter
  change: |
    add a completion callback to updateHeaders interface. Any external cache implementations will need to update to match this new interface. See changes to simple_http_cache in PR#23666 for example.
- area: cache_filter
  change: |
    api path of work-in-progress extension changed from ``api/extensions/cache/simple_http_cache`` to ``api/extensions/http/cache/simple_http_cache``, and source code moved, to match extension category.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Requests which match the passthrough header now have their own metric ``oauth_passthrough`` and aren't included in ``oauth_success`` anymore.
- area: rate_limit
  change: |
    add ``MONTH`` and ``YEAR`` to the unit of time for rate limit.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: aws_lambda
  change: |
    fix a bug when :ref:`PerRouteConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.aws_lambda.v3.PerRouteConfig>` is defined and was routing to a target cluster's AWS Lambda endpoint
    in a region that is different from the region obtained in :ref:`arn <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.aws_lambda.v3.Config.arn>` of aws_lambda http_filter configuration
    then the authorization header included in the request towards AWS Lambda was not signed with the region specified in PerRouteConfig.
- area: grpc_json_transcoder
  change: |
    fix a bug when using http2, request body has google.api.HttpBody and the size is < 16KB, it will cause EOF from the backend grpc server.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed a bug that incorrectly rewrote the path when using ``regex_rewrite`` for redirects matched on prefix.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    fixed a bug when passthrough header was matched, envoy would always remove the authorization header. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_header_passthrough_fix`` to false.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    fixed a bug that encoder filters and decoder filters of generic proxy will be executed in the same order. The encoder filters' execuate order should be the reverse of decoder filters' in the generic proxy.
- area: quic
  change: |
    reject configs that specify require_client_certificate with QUIC since clients certificates are currently unsupported in QUIC. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_require_client_certificate_with_quic`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a bug where Utility::PercentEncoding::encode() encodes some characters incorrectly because it was treating the value as negative.
- area: validation
  change: |
    fixed a crash which could happen when optional ``engine_type`` is not provided in regex.
