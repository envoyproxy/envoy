new_features:
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added support for request payloads in HTTP health checks. The ``send`` field in ``HttpHealthCheck`` can now be
    used to specify a request body to be sent during health checking. This feature supports both hex-encoded text
    and binary payloads, similar to TCP health checks. The payload can only be used with HTTP methods that support
    request bodies (POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS). Methods that must not have request bodies (GET, HEAD, DELETE, TRACE)
    are validated and will throw an error if combined with payloads. The implementation is optimized to process the
    payload once during configuration and reuse it for all health check requests. See :ref:`HttpHealthCheck
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck>` for configuration details.
- area: router_check_tool
  change: |
    Added support for testing routes with :ref:`dynamic metadata matchers <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteMatch.dynamic_metadata>`
    in the router check tool. The tool now accepts a ``dynamic_metadata`` field in test input to set metadata
    that can be matched by route configuration. This allows comprehensive testing of routes that depend on
    dynamic metadata for routing decisions.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``filterState()`` on ``streamInfo()`` which provides access to filter state objects stored during request processing.
    This allows Lua scripts to retrieve string, boolean, and numeric values stored by various filters for use in routing decisions,
    header modifications, and other processing logic. See :ref:`Filter State API <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_filter_state_wrapper>`
    for more details.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Add the :ref:`rate_limits
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.rate_limits>`
    field to generate rate limit descriptors. If this field is set, the
    :ref:`VirtualHost.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` or
    :ref:`RouteAction.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.rate_limits>` fields will be ignored. However,
    :ref:`RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits>`
    will take precedence over this field.
