behavior_changes:
- area: http
  change: |
    A route refresh will now result in a tracing refresh. The trace sampling decision and decoration
    of the new route will be applied to the active span.
    This change can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.trace_refresh_after_route_refresh`` to ``false``.
    Note, if :ref:`pack_trace_reason
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.request_id.uuid.v3.UuidRequestIdConfig.pack_trace_reason>` is set
    to ``true`` (it is ``true`` by default), a request marked as traced cannot be unmarked as traced
    after the tracing refresh.
- area: http2
  change: |
    The default value for the :ref:`maximum number of concurrent streams in HTTP/2
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_concurrent_streams>`
    has been changed from 2147483647 to 1024.
    The default value for the :ref:`initial stream window size in HTTP/2
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http2ProtocolOptions.initial_stream_window_size>`
    has been changed from 256MiB to 16MiB.
    The default value for the :ref:`initial connection window size in HTTP/2
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.Http2ProtocolOptions.initial_connection_window_size>`
    has been changed from 256MiB to 24MiB.
    This change could be reverted temporarily by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.safe_http2_options``
    to ``false``.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Reverted `#39740 <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/39740>`_ to re-enable ``fail_open`` +
    ``FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`` configuration combination.
- area: load balancing
  change: |
    Moved locality WRR structures out of ``HostSetImpl`` and into a separate class. Locality WRR schedulers are now by default owned
    and constructed by the underlying Zone Aware LB, instead of owned and constructed by the Host Set. There should be no visible
    behavior change for existing users of Zone Aware LBs.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: tap
  change: |
    Previously, streamed trace buffered data was only flushed when it reached the configured size.
    If the threshold was never met, the data remained buffered until the connection was closed.
    With this change, buffered data will be flushed proactively. Specifically, if the buffer does not
    reach the configured size but has been held for more than 15 seconds, it will be sent immediately.
- area: websocket
  change: |
    Allow 4xx and 5xx to go through the filter chain for the WebSocket handshake response check. This behavior can be
    disabled by the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.websocket_allow_4xx_5xx_through_filter_chain``.
- area: websocket
  change: |
      Support route and per-try timeouts on websocket upgrade. This can be disabled by the runtime guard
      ``envoy.reloadable_features.websocket_enable_timeout_on_upgrade_response``.
- area: testing
  change: |
    In test code for external extensions, matchers ``Http::HeaderValueOf``, ``HasHeader``, and ``HeaderHasValueRef``
    must be replaced with ``ContainsHeader``.
    Any uses of matcher ``HeaderHasValue(...)`` should be replaced with ``::testing::Pointee(ContainsHeader(...))``.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    Generic proxy codec adds the same buffer limit as the connection buffer limit. If the buffer limit is
    exceeded, the connection is disconnected. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.generic_proxy_codec_buffer_limit`` to ``false``.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Turned off HTTP/3 happy eyeballs in upstream via the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http3_happy_eyeballs``.
    It was found to favor TCP over QUIC when UDP does not work on IPv6 but works on IPv4.
- area: mobile
  change: |
    Explicitly drain connections upon network change events regardless of whether the DNS cache is refreshed or not.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.decouple_explicit_drain_pools_and_dns_refresh`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added accounting for decompressed HTTP header bytes sent and received. Existing stats only count wire-encoded header bytes.
    This can be accessed through the ``%UPSTREAM_DECOMPRESSED_HEADER_BYTES_RECEIVED%``,
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_DECOMPRESSED_HEADER_BYTES_RECEIVED%``, ``%UPSTREAM_DECOMPRESSED_HEADER_BYTES_SENT%``, and
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_DECOMPRESSED_HEADER_BYTES_SENT%`` access log command operators.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added response code details to ``401`` local responses generated by the OAuth2 filter.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    If :ref:`failure_mode_allow <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.failure_mode_allow>` is true,
    save the gRPC failure status code returned from the ext_proc server in the filter state.
    Previously, all fail-open cases would return ``call_status`` ``Grpc::Status::Aborted``.
- area: dns_filter
  change: |
    Honor the default DNS resolver configuration in the bootstrap config
    :ref:`typed_dns_resolver_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.typed_dns_resolver_config>` if the
    :ref:`client_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3.DnsFilterConfig.client_config>` is empty.
- area: grpc_json_transcoder
  change: |
    Cap the frame size for streamed grpc at 1MB. Without this change there was a small chance
    that if a request streamed in sufficiently faster than it was processed, a frame larger than
    4MB could be encoded, which most upstream grpc services would, by default, treat as an error.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where when a downstream TCP connection is created and the upstream connection is not fully established, no idle timeout
    is set on the downstream connection, which may lead to a connection leak if the client does not close the connection.
    The fix is to set an idle timeout on the downstream connection immediately after creation.
    This fix can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.tcp_proxy_set_idle_timer_immediately_on_new_connection`` to ``false``.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a crash in the UDP proxy that occurred during ``ENVOY_SIGTERM`` when active tunneling sessions were present.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in the MaxMind provider where the ``found_entry`` field in the lookup result was not checked before
    trying to populate headers with data. If this field is not checked the provider could try to populate headers
    with wrong data, as per the documentation for the MaxMind library
    `libmaxminddb.md <https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb/blob/main/doc/libmaxminddb.md#mmdb_lookup_result_s>`_.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the access log was skipped for HTTP/3 requests when the stream was half closed. This behavior can be
    reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_fix_defer_logging_miss_for_half_closed_stream`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where premature resets of streams could result in recursive draining and a potential
    stack overflow. Setting a proper ``max_concurrent_streams`` value for HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 could eliminate
    the risk of a stack overflow before this fix.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where comparing listeners did not consider the network namespace they were listening in.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the ``response_headers_to_add`` may be processed multiple times for the local responses from
    the router filter.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the ``%TRACE_ID%`` command cannot work properly at the header mutations.
- area: listeners
  change: |
    Fixed an issue where :ref:`TLS inspector listener filter <config_listener_filters_tls_inspector>` timed out
    when used with other listener filters. The bug was triggered when a previous listener filter processed more data
    than the TLS inspector had requested, causing the TLS inspector to incorrectly calculate its buffer growth strategy.
    The fix ensures that buffer growth is now based on actual bytes available rather than the previously requested amount.
- area: listener
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where a failure to create listener sockets in different Linux network namespaces was
    not handled properly. The success of the netns switch was not checked before attempting to
    access the result of the socket creation. This is only relevant for Linux and if a listening
    socket address was specified with a non-default network namespace.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Added missing session name, session duration, and ``external_id`` parameters in AssumeRole credentials provider.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed a bug introduced in PR `#40228 <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/40228>`_, where OAuth2 cookies were
    removed for requests matching the ``pass_through_matcher`` configuration. This broke setups with multiple OAuth2
    filter instances using different ``pass_through_matcher`` configurations, because the first matching instance removed
    the OAuth2 cookies--even when a passthrough was intended--impacting subsequent filters that still needed those cookies.
- area: stats
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the metric name ``expiration_unix_time_seconds`` of
    ``cluster.<cluster_name>.ssl.certificate.<cert_name>.<metric_name>``
    and ``listener.<address>.ssl.certificate.<cert_name>.<metric_name>``
    was not being properly extracted in the final Prometheus stat name.
- area: odcds
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where using OD-CDS without cds_config would not work in some
    cases. This change introduces a new internal OD-CDS component. This change
    could be reverted temporarily by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.odcds_over_ads_fix`` to ``false``.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Fixed an issue where cookies prefixed with ``__Secure-`` or ``__Host-`` were not receiving a
    ``Secure`` attribute.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Fixed a use-after-free (UAF) in DNS cache that can occur when the ``Host`` header is modified between the Dynamic
    Forwarding Proxy and Router filters.
- area: release
  change: |
    Fixed the distroless image to ensure nonroot.

new_features:
- area: stats
  change: |
    Added support to remove unused metrics from memory for extensions that
    support evictable metrics. This is done :ref:`periodically
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.stats_eviction_interval>`
    during the metric flush.
- area: tap
  change: |
    Added :ref:`record_upstream_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.tap.v3.Tap.record_upstream_connection>`
    to determine whether upstream connection information is recorded in the HTTP buffer trace output.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added new option to support :ref:`base64 encoded server ID
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.quic.connection_id_generator.quic_lb.v3.Config.server_id_base64_encoded>`
    in QUIC-LB.
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added support for request payloads in HTTP health checks. The ``send`` field in ``HttpHealthCheck`` can now be
    used to specify a request body to be sent during health checking. This feature supports both hex-encoded text
    and binary payloads, similar to TCP health checks. The payload can only be used with HTTP methods that support
    request bodies (``POST``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH``, ``OPTIONS``). Methods that must not have request bodies
    (``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``DELETE``, ``TRACE``) are validated and will throw an error if combined with payloads.
    The implementation is optimized to process the payload once during configuration and reuse it for all health
    check requests. See :ref:`HttpHealthCheck <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck>` for configuration details.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    Added support for generating and propagating a request ID on synthesized upstream HTTP requests when tunneling requests.
    It can be configured using :ref:`request_id_extension
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.TunnelingConfig.request_id_extension>`.
- area: router_check_tool
  change: |
    Added support for testing routes with :ref:`dynamic metadata matchers <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteMatch.dynamic_metadata>`
    in the router check tool. The tool now accepts a ``dynamic_metadata`` field in test input to set metadata
    that can be matched by route configuration. This allows comprehensive testing of routes that depend on
    dynamic metadata for routing decisions.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``filterState()`` to ``streamInfo()`` which provides access to filter state objects stored during request processing.
    This allows Lua scripts to retrieve string, boolean, and numeric values stored by various filters for use in routing decisions,
    header modifications, and other processing logic. See :ref:`Filter State API <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_filter_state_wrapper>`
    for more details.
- area: socket
  change: |
    Added ``network_namespace_filepath`` to :ref:`SocketAddress <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.SocketAddress>`. This field allows
    specifying a Linux network namespace filepath for socket creation, enabling network isolation in containerized environments.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added the :ref:`rate_limits
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.rate_limits>`
    field to generate rate limit descriptors. If this field is set, the
    :ref:`VirtualHost.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` or
    :ref:`RouteAction.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.rate_limits>` fields will be ignored. However,
    :ref:`RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits>`
    will take precedence over this field.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for thirty-three new Redis commands including ``COPY``, ``RPOPLPUSH``, ``SMOVE``, ``SUNION``, ``SDIFF``,
    ``SINTER``, ``SINTERSTORE``, ``ZUNIONSTORE``, ``ZINTERSTORE``, ``PFMERGE``, ``GEORADIUS``, ``GEORADIUSBYMEMBER``,
    ``RENAME``, ``SORT``, ``SORT_RO``, ``ZMSCORE``, ``SDIFFSTORE``, ``MSETNX``, ``SUBSTR``, ``ZRANGESTORE``, ``ZUNION``,
    ``ZDIFF``, ``SUNIONSTORE``, ``SMISMEMBER``, ``HRANDFIELD``, ``GEOSEARCHSTORE``, ``ZDIFFSTORE``, ``ZINTER``, ``ZRANDMEMBER``,
    ``BITOP``, ``LPOS``, ``RENAMENX``.
- area: observability
  change: |
    Added ``ENVOY_NOTIFICATION`` macro to track specific conditions in production environments.
- area: dns_filter, redis_proxy and prefix_matcher_map
  change: |
    Switch to using Radix Tree instead of Trie for performance improvements.
- area: header_to_metadata
  change: |
    Added optional statistics collection for the Header-To-Metadata filter. When the :ref:`stat_prefix
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.header_to_metadata.v3.Config.stat_prefix>` field is configured,
    the filter emits detailed counters for rule processing, metadata operations, etc. See
    :ref:`Header-To-Metadata filter statistics <config_http_filters_header_to_metadata>` for details.
- area: load_reporting
  change: |
    Added support for endpoint-level load stats and metrics reporting. Locality load reports now include per
    endpoint statistics and metrics, but only for endpoints with updated stats, optimizing report size and efficiency.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    Added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.http2_server_go_away_and_close_on_dispatch``
    that sends ``GOAWAY`` and closes connections for HTTP/2 server processing of requests. When
    a ``GOAWAY`` frame is submitted by this load shed point, the counter ``http2.goaway_sent`` will be
    incremented.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added :ref:`request_body_buffer_limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.request_body_buffer_limit>` and
    :ref:`request_body_buffer_limit
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.request_body_buffer_limit>` configuration fields
    to enable buffering of large request bodies beyond connection buffer limits.
- area: otlp_stat_sink
  change: |
    Added support for resource attributes. The stat sink will use the resource attributes configured for the OpenTelemetry tracer via
    :ref:`resource_detectors <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.OpenTelemetryConfig.resource_detectors>`.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``virtualHost()`` to the Stream handle API, allowing Lua scripts to retrieve virtual host information. So far, the only method
    implemented is ``metadata()``, allowing Lua scripts to access virtual host metadata scoped to the specific filter name. See
    :ref:`Virtual host object API <config_http_filters_lua_virtual_host_wrapper>` for more details.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added support for per-route gRPC service override in the ``ext_authz`` HTTP filter. This allows different routes
    to use different external authorization backends by configuring a
    :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.CheckSettings.grpc_service>`
    in the per-route ``check_settings``. Routes without this configuration continue to use the default
    authorization service.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added :ref:`status_on_error <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.status_on_error>`
    to the ``ext_proc`` HTTP filter. This allows configuring the HTTP status code returned to the downstream
    client when communication with the external processor fails (e.g., gRPC error). Previously, these cases returned a
    fixed ``500``.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Added :ref:`trace_context_option <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.ZipkinConfig.trace_context_option>` enum
    in the Zipkin tracer config. When set to ``USE_B3_WITH_W3C_PROPAGATION``, the tracer will:
    extract trace information from W3C trace headers when B3 headers are not present (downstream),
    and inject both B3 and W3C trace headers for upstream requests to maximize compatibility.
    The default value ``USE_B3`` maintains backward compatibility with B3-only behavior.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Enhanced Zipkin tracer with advanced collector configuration via
    :ref:`collector_service <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.ZipkinConfig.collector_service>`
    using ``HttpService``. New features include:

    #. **Custom HTTP Headers**: Add headers to collector requests for custom metadata, service identification,
       and collector-specific routing.

    #. **Full URI Parsing**: The ``uri`` field now supports both path-only (``/api/v2/spans``) and
       full URI formats (``https://zipkin-collector.example.com/api/v2/spans``). When using full URIs,
       Envoy automatically extracts hostname and path components - hostname sets the HTTP ``Host`` header,
       and path sets the request path. Path-only URIs fall back to using the cluster name as the hostname.

    When configured, ``collector_service`` takes precedence over legacy configuration fields (``collector_cluster``,
    ``collector_endpoint``, ``collector_hostname``), which will be deprecated in a future release. Legacy configuration
    does not support custom headers or URI parsing.
- area: composite
  change: |
    Allow the composite filter to be configured to insert a filter into the filter chain outside of the decode headers lifecycle phase.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Switched the IP matcher to use LC-Trie for performance improvements.
- area: tls_inspector
  change: |
    Added dynamic metadata when failing to parse the ``ClientHello``.
- area: matching
  change: |
    Added :ref:`NetworkNamespaceInput
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.matching.common_inputs.network.v3.NetworkNamespaceInput>` to the
    matcher framework. This input returns the listener address's ``network_namespace_filepath``
    for use with :ref:`filter_chain_matcher
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.filter_chain_matcher>`, enabling filter chain
    selection based on the Linux network namespace of the bound socket. On non-Linux platforms,
    the input returns an empty value and connections use the default filter chain.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added ``route()`` to the Stream handle API, allowing Lua scripts to retrieve route information. So far, the only method
    implemented is ``metadata()``, allowing Lua scripts to access route metadata scoped to the specific filter name. See
    :ref:`Route object API <config_http_filters_lua_route_wrapper>` for more details.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Added a new ``%TYPED_CEL%`` formatter command that, unlike ``%CEL%``, can output non-string values (number, boolean, null, etc.)
    when used in formatting contexts that accept non-string values, such as
    :ref:`json_format <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SubstitutionFormatString.json_format>`. The new command is introduced
    so as to not break compatibility with the existing command's behavior.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added a new Logging ABI that allows modules to emit logs in the standard Envoy logging stream under ``dynamic_modules`` ID.
    In the Rust SDK, they are available as ``envoy_log_info``, etc.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added ``upstream_rq_per_cx`` histogram to track requests per connection for monitoring connection reuse efficiency.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added
    :ref:`stream_flush_timeout
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.stream_flush_timeout>`
    to allow for configuring a stream flush timeout independently from the stream idle timeout.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added support for header removal based on header key matching. The new
    :ref:`remove_on_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.common.mutation_rules.v3.HeaderMutation.remove_on_match>`
    allows removing headers that match a specified key pattern. This enables more flexible and
    dynamic header manipulation based on header names.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Added a new metric ``db_build_epoch`` to track the build timestamp of the MaxMind geolocation database files.
    This can be used to monitor the freshness of the databases currently in use by the filter.
    See `MaxMind-DB build_epoch <https://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/#build_epoch>`_ for more details.
- area: overload management
  change: |
    Added a new scaled timer type ``HttpDownstreamStreamFlush`` to the overload manager. This allows
    Envoy to scale the periodic timer for flushing downstream responses based on resource pressure.
    The new timer can be configured via the
    :ref:`ScaleTimersOverloadActionConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.overload.v3.ScaleTimersOverloadActionConfig>`.
- area: dynamic_modules
  change: |
    Added support for counters, gauges, histograms, and their vector variants to the dynamic modules API.
- area: dns_resolver
  change: |
    Added :ref:`max_udp_channel_duration
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.cares.v3.CaresDnsResolverConfig.max_udp_channel_duration>`
    configuration field to the c-ares DNS resolver. This allows periodic refresh of the UDP channel
    to help avoid stale socket states and provide better load distribution across UDP ports.
