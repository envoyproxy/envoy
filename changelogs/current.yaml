- area: adaptive concurrency filter stats
  change: |
    Multiply the gradient value stat by 1000 to make it more granular (values will range between 500 and 2000).

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: tracers
  change: |
    use unary RPC calls for OpenTelemetry trace exports, rather than client-side streaming connections.

# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: grpc reverse bridge
  change: |
    Change HTTP status to 200 to respect the gRPC protocol. This may cause problems for incorrect gRPC clients expecting the filter
    to preserve HTTP 1.1 responses.  This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.grpc_http1_reverse_bridge_change_http_status`` to false.
