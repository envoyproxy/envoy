behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: jwt
  change: |
    Changed behavior of the jwt extraction, passing entire token for validation, instead cut him in the non-Base64 character.
    This change can be reverted temporarily by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.token_passed_entirely`` to false.
- area: eds
  change: |
    Introduced caching of EDS assignments when used with ADS. Prior to this change, Envoy required that EDS assignments were sent
    after an EDS cluster was updated. If no EDS assignment was received for the cluster, it ended up with an empty assignment.
    Following this change, after a cluster update, Envoy waits for an EDS assignment until
    :ref:`initial_fetch_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.initial_fetch_timeout>` times out, and will then apply
    the cached assignment and finish updating the warmed cluster. This change is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting
    the runtime flag ``envoy.restart_features.use_eds_cache_for_ads`` to true.
- area: http
  change: |
    Switch from http_parser to BalsaParser for handling HTTP/1.1 traffic. See https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/21245 for
    details. This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_use_balsa_parser`` to
    false.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    removing any query parameter in the presence of repeated query parameter keys no longer drops the repeats.
- area: alternate_protocols_cache_filter
  change: |
    Changed the alternate protocols cache filter to get the cache from cluster config rather than filter config.
    This allows one downstream filter to be used with multiple clusters with different caches. This change can be reverted by
    setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_cluster_cache_for_alt_protocols_filter`` to false.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Don't append the local address to ``x-forwarded-for`` header when sending an http (not gRPC) auth request.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_authz_http_send_original_xff`` to false.
- area: outlier detection
  change: |
    Outlier detection will always respect max_ejection_percent now.
    This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.check_mep_on_first_eject`` to false.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Enable QUICHE request and response headers validation. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.FLAGS_envoy_quic_reloadable_flag_quic_act_upon_invalid_header`` to false.
- area: http oauth2 filter
  change: |
    Change HMAC cookie encoding to base64-encoded only. This change can be reverted temporarily by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.hmac_base64_encoding_only`` to false.
- area: router
  change: |
    Enable copying response_code from the upstream stream_info onto the downstream stream_info.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.copy_response_code_to_downstream_stream_info`` to false.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: connection limit
  change: |
    fixed a use-after-free bug in the connection limit filter.
- area: subset load balancer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where
    :ref:`overprovisioning_factor<envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment.Policy.overprovisioning_factor>` and
    :ref:`weighted_priority_health <envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.ClusterLoadAssignment.Policy.weighted_priority_health>`
    values were not respected when subset load balacing was enabled. The default values of 140 and false were always used.
- area: redis
  change: |
    fixed a bug where redis key formatter is using the closed stream because of life time issues.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    Fixed a bug causing crash if ECDS is used with upstream HTTP filters.
- area: tls
  change: |
    fixed a bug where handshake may fail when both private key provider and cert validation are set.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where when respect_dns_ttl was set to true, c-ares dns resolver only considered address record for ttl calculation
    while ignoring CNAME records TTL. Now when respect_dns_ttl is set to true minimum of all TTL records is considered.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where dns response was not always conforming [RFC 2181](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181) for TTL values.
    Previously a malicious user could add a TTL greater than 2^31 - 1, and with c-ares library using 32 bit signed int data type
    would overflow and send a negative TTL.
- area: healthcheck
  change: |
    The default behavior of unejecting outlier-detection-ejected host on successful active health checking can
    be disabled by setting :ref:`outlier_detection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.OutlierDetection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host>`
    to ``false``. This new configuration flag is a substitute for the removed runtime option
    ``envoy.reloadable_features_successful_active_health_check_uneject_host``.
- area: aws signer
  change: |
    fixed a bug where expiration timestamp on task roles failed to validate. This causes failure of credential caching which
    results in constant hits to the task role metadata URL.
- area: router check tool
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the route coverage is not correctly calculated when a route has weighted clusters.

removed_config_or_runtime:

    substituted it with :ref:`outlier_detection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.OutlierDetection.successful_active_health_check_uneject_host>`
    outlier detection configuration flag.

new_features:
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added %RESPONSE_FLAGS_LONG% substitution string, that will output a pascal case string representing the resonse flags.
    The output response flags will correspond with %RESPONSE_FLAGS%, only with a long textual string representation.
- area: config
  change: |
    Added the capability to defer broadcasting of certain cluster (CDS, EDS) to
    worker threads from the main thread. This optimization can save significant
    amount of memory in cases where there are (1) a large number of workers and
    (2) a large amount of config, most of which is unused. This capability is
    guarded by :ref:`enable_deferred_cluster_creation
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.ClusterManager.enable_deferred_cluster_creation>`.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added ECDS support for :ref:` downstream network filters<envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Filter.config_discovery>`.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    added
    :ref:`disable_immediate_response <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.disable_immediate_response>`
    config API to ignore the
    :ref:`immediate_response <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse.immediate_response>`
    message from the external processing server.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added a field lookup to %FILTER_STATE% for objects that have reflection enabled.

- area: http
  change: |
    added :ref:`Json-To-Metadata filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.json_to_metadata.v3.JsonToMetadata>`.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added metric listener.listener_stat.network_extension_config_missing to track closed connections due to missing config.
- area: redis
  change: |
    added support for time command (returns a local response).
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added ECDS support for :ref:` upstream network filters<envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Filter.config_discovery>`.
- area: redis
  change: |
    added support for lmove command.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added :ref:`allow_redundant_keys <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.load_balancing_policies.subset.v3.Subset.allow_redundant_keys>`
    to suppport redundant keys in request metadata for subset load balancing.
- area: access_logs
  change: |
    added :ref:`json_format_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SubstitutionFormatString.json_format_options>` config option to
    support JSON output formatting and the :ref:`sort_properties <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.JsonFormatOptions.sort_properties>`
    option to print the JSON output with sorted properties.
- area: tap
  change: |
    added :ref:`custom_sink <envoy_v3_api_field_config.tap.v3.OutputSink.custom_sink>` type to enable writing tap data
    out to a custom sink extension.
- area: tap
  change: |
    added :ref:`record_headers_received_time <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.tap.v3.Tap.record_headers_received_time>`
    to control writing request and response headers received time in trace output.
