behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.

    Fix a bug where Lua filters may result in Envoy crashes when setting response body to a

- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fix a crash in the TCP connection pool that occurs during downstream connection teardown when large requests
    or responses trigger flow control.
