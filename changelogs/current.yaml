    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.

  change: |
    The fixed heap resource monitor can now calculate memory pressure as currently allocated memory divided by maximum heap size,
    giving more accurate and lower memory pressure values.
    This can avoid unnecessary load shedding or overload actions.
    To enable, set ``envoy.reloadable_features.fixed_heap_use_allocated`` to true.
    The default algorithm (heap_size - pageheap_unmapped - pageheap_free) does not discount for free memory in TCMalloc caches.
