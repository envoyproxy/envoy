behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: aws_iam
  change: |
    As announced in November 2024 (see https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/37621), the
    grpc_credentials/aws_iam extension is being deleted. Any configuration referencing this extension
    will fail to load.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: lua
  change: |
    The ``metadata()`` of lua filter now will search the metadata by the :ref:`filter config name
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpFilter.name>` first.
    And if not found, it will search by the canonical name of the filter ``envoy.filters.http.lua``.
- area: grpc-json
  change: |
    Make the :ref:`gRPC JSON transcoder filter's <config_http_filters_grpc_json_reverse_transcoder>` json print options configurable.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Reset CSRF token when token validation fails during redirection.
    If the CSRF token cookie is present during the redirection to the authorization server, it will be validated.
    Previously, if this validation failed, the oauth flow would fail. Now the CSRF token will simply be reset. This fixes
    the case where an hmac secret change causes a redirect flow, but the CSRF token cookie hasn't yet expired
    causing a CSRF token validation failure.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Precompile regexes in cel expressions. This can be disabled by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_cel_regex_precompilation`` to false.
