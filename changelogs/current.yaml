behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: dynamic modules
  change: |
    The dynamic module ABI has been updated to support streaming body manipulation. This change also
    fixed potential incorrect behavior when access or modify the request or response body. See
    https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/40918 for more details.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: bootstrap
  change: |
    Fixed an issue where the custom
    :ref:`header_prefix <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.header_prefix>`
    will result in crash at startup.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: overload management
  change: |
    The fixed heap resource monitor can now calculate memory pressure as currently allocated memory divided by maximum heap size,
    giving more accurate and lower memory pressure values.
    This can avoid unnecessary load shedding or overload actions.
    To enable, set ``envoy.reloadable_features.fixed_heap_use_allocated`` to true.
    The default algorithm (heap_size - pageheap_unmapped - pageheap_free) does not discount for free memory in TCMalloc caches.
