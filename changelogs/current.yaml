behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: connection pool
  change: |
    Fix a crash in the TCP connection pool that occurs during downstream connection teardown when large requests
    or responses trigger flow control.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`
- area: http
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_balsa_allow_cr_or_lf_at_request_start`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: quic
  change: |
    Add a new quic configuration field, 'max_sessions_per_event_loop', to QuicProtocolOptions in Envoy listener.
    This allows tuning the maximum number of new QUIC sessions created within a single event loop.
    The default value is 16, preserving the previous hardcoded limit.
