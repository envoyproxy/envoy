behavior_changes:
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Removed support for (long deprecated) opentracing.  See `issue 27401
    <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27401>`_ for details.
- area: golang
  change: |
    Change ``OnLogDownstreamStart``, ``OnLogDownstreamPeriodic`` and ``OnLog`` methods so that user can get the request/response's
    headers and trailers when producing access log.
- area: http
  change: |
    Allow HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 upstream servers to half close the stream before the downstream. This enables bidirectional
    gRPC streams where server completes streaming before the client. Behavior of HTTP/1 or TCP proxy upstream servers is
    unchanged and the stream is reset if the upstream server completes response before the downstream. The stream is also
    reset if the upstream server responds with an error status before the downstream. This behavior is disabled by default
    and can be enabled by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_multiplexed_upstream_half_close`` runtime key to true.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added HTTP/1-safe option for :ref:`max_connection_duration
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.max_connection_duration>` in
    HttpConnectionManager. When enabled, ``max_connection_duration`` will only drain downstream
    HTTP/1 connections by adding the ``Connection: close`` response header; it will never cause the
    ``HttpConnectionManager`` to close the connection itself.  Defaults to off (allows "unsafe" connection closing)
    but is configurable via :ref:`http1_safe_max_connection_duration
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.http1_safe_max_connection_duration>`.
- area: eds
  change: |
    Enabling caching of EDS assignments when used with ADS by default (introduced in Envoy v1.28).
    Prior to this change, Envoy required that EDS assignments were sent after an EDS cluster was updated.
    If no EDS assignment was received for the cluster, it ended up with an empty assignment.
    Following this change, after a cluster update, Envoy waits for an EDS assignment until
    :ref:`initial_fetch_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ConfigSource.initial_fetch_timeout>` times out, and will then apply
    the cached assignment and finish updating the warmed cluster. This change can be temporarily disabled by setting
    the runtime flag ``envoy.restart_features.use_eds_cache_for_ads`` to ``false``.
- area: stats scoped_rds
  change: |
    Added new tag extraction so that scoped rds stats have their ``scope_route_config_name`` and stat prefix extracted.
- area: http
  change: |
    The default configuration of Envoy will continue to trust internal addresses while in the future it will not trust them by default.
    If you have tooling such as probes on your private network which need to be treated as trusted (e.g. changing arbitrary ``x-envoy``
    headers) please explictily include those addresses or CIDR ranges into :ref:`internal_address_config
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.internal_address_config>`
    See the config examples from the above ``internal_address_config`` link. You can turn up or test
    the upcoming internal address defaults by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.explicit_internal_address_config`` to ``true``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Access log handlers added by filters will now be evaluated before access
    log handlers that configured in the :ref:`access_log configuration
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.access_log>`.
    This change can be disabled by setting the runtime guard flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.filter_access_loggers_first`` to ``false``.
- area: monitoring
  change: |
    Removed runtime feature flag ``envoy.restart_features.enable_execution_context``. The execution context feature
    can instead be enabled by setting compile option ``--define=execution_context=enabled``.

minor_behavior_changes:
- area: command line options
  change: |
    :option:`--enable-fine-grain-logging` and :option:`--component-log-level` were incompatible in that one
    would make the other ineffective. Setting both options at once is now an error, to reduce potential confusion.
- area: tcp
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`connection_pool_per_downstream_connection
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.connection_pool_per_downstream_connection>` flag in tcp connection pool.
- area: http3
  change: |
    The ``ACCEPT_UNTRUSTED`` option now works more consistently for HTTP/3 requests. This change is
    guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.extend_h3_accept_untrusted``.
- area: http3
  change: |
    HTTP/3 ``alt-svc`` headers will now be respected from IP-address-based hostnames. This change is
    guarded by runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_alt_svc_for_ips``.
- area: lua
  change: |
    When Lua scripts execute ``httpCall``, backpressure is now exercised when receiving body from downstream
    client. This behavior can be reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.lua_flow_control_while_http_call`` to ``false``.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`send_body_without_waiting_for_header_response
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.send_body_without_waiting_for_header_response>`.
- area: http
  change: |
    Modified the authority header value validator to allow the same characters as oghttp2
    plus the ``@`` character. This is compliant with nghttp2, and supports the HTTP/1 use-cases
    that allow ``user-info@`` as part of the authority. This behavior can be reverted by setting
    the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.internal_authority_header_validator`` to ``false``.
- area: sni
  change: |
    When computing SNI and SAN value for the auto-sni and auto-san verification feature,
    route host manipulations are now taken into account. This behavior can be reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy_reloadable_features_use_route_host_mutation_for_auto_sni_san`` to ``false``.
- area: aws
  change: |
    AWS request signing common code now uses the HTTP async client by default, moving curl to the
    deprecation path. This behavior change can be
    reverted by setting the ``envoy_reloadable_features_use_http_client_to_fetch_aws_credentials``
    runtime flag to ``false``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    UDP client connection sockets are now connected before use and sockets will only bind if
    the local address is specified. This behavior change can be reverted by setting the
    ``envoy_reloadable_features_quic_connect_client_udp_sockets`` runtime flag to ``false``.
- area: http_11_proxy
  change: |
    Made the inner ``transport_socket`` field optional in the proto configuration.
- area: conn_handler
  change: |
    Enhanced listener filter chain execution to handle the case that listener filter has ``maxReadBytes()`` of 0,
    but may return ``StopIteration`` in ``onAccept`` to wait for asynchronous callback.
- area: tracers
  change: |
    Set status code based on gRPC status code for OpenTelemetry tracers (previously unset).
- area: xds-failover
  change: |
    Add the ability to stick with either the primary or the failover xDS sources once Envoy connects to one of them.
    To use the prior behavior, set the runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.xds_failover_to_primary_enabled`` to ``false``.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Changed the default value of ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to ``false``. This changes the codec used for HTTP/2
    requests and responses to address to address stability concerns. This behavior can be reverted by setting the feature to ``true``.
- area: udp
  change: |
    Envoy now sets the Don't Fragment (``DF``) flag bit on IP packet header on UDP listener sockets and
    QUIC upstream connection sockets. This behavior
    can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.udp_set_do_not_fragment`` to ``false``.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Sanitize SNI for potential log injection. The invalid character will be replaced by ``_`` with an ``invalid:`` marker.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting
    runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_sni_in_access_log`` to ``false``.

bug_fixes:
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Use previously calculated healthcheck when endpoints move priority levels repeatedly.
- area: dispatcher
  change: |
    Update approximate now after polling instead of before polling. This is only used by QUIC.
    The behavior can be reverted by setting ``envoy.restart_features.fix_dispatcher_approximate_now`` to ``false``.
- area: dns
  change: |
    The DNS filter no longer returns ``FORMERR`` if a message has an ``ID`` of 0.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixes access log formatter ``%CONNECTION_ID%`` for QUIC connections.
- area: c-ares
  change: |
    Applying a C-ares patch to fix DNS resoultion by the Google gRPC library.
- area: websocket
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the websocket upgrade filter would not take into account per-filter configs.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Add runtime guard for timeout error code ``504 Gateway Timeout`` that is returned to downstream. If runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_proc_timeout_error`` is set to ``false``, old error code ``500 Internal Server Error``
    will be returned.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    RBAC will now allow stat prefixes configured in per-route config to override the base config's
    stat prefix.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Fixed bug where an upstream that sent a ``GOAWAY`` and gracefully closed a connection would result in an increment of
    the cluster stat ``upstream_cx_protocol_error`` and setting the ``UpstreamProtocolError`` response flag. This behavior
    can be reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_no_protocol_error_upon_clean_close``
    to ``false``.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where an empty trailers block could be sent. This would occur if a filter removed
    the last trailer - a likely occurrence with the ``grpc_web_filter``. This change makes HTTP/3
    behave the same way HTTP/2 does, converting an empty trailers block to no trailers.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.http3_remove_empty_trailers`` to ``false``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where an incomplete request (missing body or trailers) may be proxied to the upstream when the limit on
    the number of requests per I/O cycle is configured and an HTTP decoder filter that pauses filter chain is present. This behavior
    can be reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_filter_manager_state_for_downstream_end_stream``
    to ``false``.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Fixed a bug using hard coded drop category when reporting drop_overload stats to the load report service.
    It is changed to use drop category that is set in
    :ref:`category <envoy_v3_api_field_config.endpoint.v3.clusterloadassignment.policy.DropOverload.category>`.
- area: proxy_filter
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in the ``CONNECT`` implementation that would cause the ``CONNECT`` request created to be invalid when the
    hostname contains a port number. When the port number is not specified, the port 443 will be automatically added.
    This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.proxy_ssl_port`` to ``false``.
- area: runtime
  change: |
    Fixed an inconsistency in how boolean values are loaded in RTDS, where they were previously converted to ``1``/``0``
    instead of ``true``/``false``. The correct string representation (``true``/``false``) will now be used. This change can be
    reverted by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.boolean_to_string_fix`` to ``false``.
- area: jwt
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where using ``clear_route_cache`` with remote JWKs works
    incorrectly and may cause a crash when the modified request does not match
    any route.
- area: http_async_client
  change: |
    Fixed the local reply and destroy order crashes when using the HTTP async client for websocket handshake.
- area: http3
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in the ``CONNECT-UDP`` forwarding mode where Envoy reset the upstream stream when it
    received HTTP/3 datagrams before receiving the SETTINGS frame from the upstream peer. Envoy now
    drops the datagrams in this case instead of resetting the stream.
- area: oauth
  change: |
    Set token cookies in response regardless of :ref:`forward_bearer_token
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.forward_bearer_token>` config option.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the OpenTelemetry tracer exports the OTLP request even when no spans are present.
- area: wasm
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where a body received in chunks is not correctly dumped, resulting in
    an incomplete dump and loss of the last chunk. This issue is manifested in HTTP/2.
- area: dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where DFP sub-cluster gets removed due to CDS update and doesn't gets recreated. This behavior can be reverted by
    setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.avoid_dfp_cluster_removal_on_cds_update`` to ``false``.

new_features:
- area: dns
  change: |
    for the :ref:`strict DNS <arch_overview_service_discovery_types_strict_dns>` and :ref:`logical DNS
    <arch_overview_service_discovery_types_logical_dns>` cluster types,
    the new :ref:`dns_jitter <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.dns_jitter>` field, if
    provided, will causes the cluster to refresh DNS entries later by a random amount of time as to
    avoid stampedes of DNS requests. This field sets the upper bound (exclusive) for the random amount.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for publish.
- area: jwt_authn
  change: |
    Added missing implementation to jwt_authn matchers to allow glob pattern matching.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added :ref:`prefer_client_ciphers
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.DownstreamTlsContext.prefer_client_ciphers>`
    to support enabling client cipher preference instead of server's for TLS handshakes.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added config field
    :ref:`filter_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.filter_metadata>`
    for injecting arbitrary data to the filter state for logging.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added ``%UPSTREAM_CLUSTER_RAW%`` access log formatter to log the original upstream cluster name, regardless of whether
    ``alt_stat_name`` is set.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added full feature absl::FormatTime() support to the DateFormatter. This allows the timepoint formatters (like
    ``%START_TIME%``) to use ``%E#S``, ``%E*S``, ``%E#f`` and ``%E*f`` to format the subsecond part of the timepoint.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added configuration setting for the :ref:`maximum size of response headers
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.max_response_headers_kb>` in responses. The default can
    be overridden with runtime key ``envoy.reloadable_features.max_response_headers_size_kb``.
- area: http_11_proxy
  change: |
    Added the option to configure the transport socket via locality or endpoint metadata.
- area: sockets
  change: |
    Added socket ``type`` field for specifying a socket type to apply the socket option to under :ref:`SocketOption
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.SocketOption>`. If not specified, the socket option will be applied to all socket
    types.
- area: quic
  change: |
    QUIC server and client support certificate compression, which can in some cases reduce the number of round trips
    required to setup a connection. This change temporarily disabled by setting the runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_support_certificate_compression`` to ``false``.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added QUIC protocol option :ref:`reject_new_connections
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.QuicProtocolOptions.reject_new_connections>` to reject connection-establishing
    packets at the QUIC layer.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added an extension point :ref:`custom_tls_certificate_selector
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CommonTlsContext.custom_tls_certificate_selector>`
    to allow overriding TLS certificate selection behavior.
    An extension can select certificate base on the incoming SNI, in both sync and async mode.
- area: oauth
  change: |
    Added :ref:`retry_policy <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.retry_policy>` to reconnect to
    the auth server when a connection fails to be established.
    Added :ref:`cookie_domain <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Credentials.cookie_domain>`
    field to OAuth2 filter to allow setting the domain of cookies.
    Added a nonce to the state parameter in the authorization request to mitigate CSRF attacks. The nonce is generated by the
    OAuth2 filter and stored in a cookie. This feature is enabled by defaut starting from this release.
- area: access log
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_CHAIN_FINGERPRINTS_1% <config_access_log_format_response_flags>`,
    ``%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_CHAIN_FINGERPRINTS_256%``, and ``%DOWNSTREAM_PEER_CHAIN_SERIALS%``, as access log formatters.
- area: matching
  change: |
    Added dynamic metadata matcher support :ref:`Dynamic metadata input <extension_envoy.matching.inputs.dynamic_metadata>`
    and :ref:`Dynamic metadata input matcher <extension_envoy.matching.matchers.metadata_matcher>`.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added the ability to modify :ref:`hits_addend <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitRequest.hits_addend>`
    by setting by setting filter state value ``envoy.ratelimit.hits_addend`` to the desired value.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added new access log command operators ``%START_TIME_LOCAL%`` and ``%EMIT_TIME_LOCAL%``,
    similar to  ``%START_TIME%`` and ``%EMIT_TIME%``, but use local time zone.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Added QUIC protocol option :ref:`save_cmsg_config
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.QuicProtocolOptions.save_cmsg_config>` to optionally specify a CMSG header type to be
    propagated from the first packet on the connection to QuicListenerFilter.
- area: apple_dns_impl
  change: |
    For the apple DNS resolver, prefer using IPv6 address when addresses from both families are available.
    Can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.prefer_ipv6_dns_on_macos`` to false.
- area: grpc_field_extraction
  change: |
    Added ``map<string, string>`` support: Target fields of type ``map<string, string>`` can be extracted and added to dynamic metadata.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Added :ref:`delay_deny <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.rbac.v3.RBAC>` to support deny connection after
    the configured duration.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added :ref:`emit_filter_state_stats <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.emit_filter_state_stats>`
    which enables filter state stats for access logging.
- area: extension_discovery_service
  change: |
    added ECDS support for :ref:`UDP session filters
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.udp_proxy.v3.UdpProxyConfig.SessionFilter.config_discovery>`.
- area: http3
  change: |
    ``http3_protocol_options`` in ``HttpConnectionManager`` has been upgraded to general access.
- area: cluster
  change: |
    Allows customizing the happy eyeballs algorithm for an upstream cluster by configuring
    :ref:`happy_eyeballs_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.UpstreamConnectionOptions.happy_eyeballs_config>`.
    A default configuration will be used if not provided. This behavior can be reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.use_config_in_happy_eyeballs`` to false.
- area: getaddrinfo
  change: |
    Added :ref:`num_retries<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig.num_retries>`
    to configure the number of DNS resolution retries. If this field is not provided, the ``getaddrinfo``
    resolver will retry indefinitely until it
    succeeds or the DNS query times out. This behavior can be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.getaddrinfo_num_retries`` to false.
- area: getaddrinfo
  change: |
    Added ``envoy.enable_dfp_dns_trace`` runtime flag to enable DNS query trace in the DNS resolution details.
- area: geoip
  change: |
    Added ``envoy.reloadable_features.mmdb_files_reload_enabled`` runtime flag that enables reload of mmdb files by default.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added new JSON access log formatter implementation which provides 16-25x performance improvement over the old
    implementation. The legacy implementation will be enabled by default for now but will be deprecated and removed
    in a future release.
    The :ref:`sort_properties <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.JsonFormatOptions.sort_properties>` field will
    be ignored in the new implementation because the new implementation always sorts properties. And the new implementation
    will always keep the value type in the JSON output. For example, the duration field will always be rendered as a number
    instead of a string.
    The new JSON formatter could be enabled by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.logging_with_fast_json_formatter`` to true.
- area: access_logs
  change: |
    Added support for ``%UPSTREAM_CONNECTION_ID%`` access log substitution string in TCP and UDP tunneling flows.
- area: redis_proxy
  change: |
    Added :ref:`external_auth_provider <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy>` to support
    external authentication for redis proxy.
- area: udp_access_logs
  change: |
    Added support for ``%BYTES_RECEIVED%``, ``%BYTES_SENT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_HEADER_BYTES_SENT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_HEADER_BYTES_RECEIVED%``,
    ``%UPSTREAM_WIRE_BYTES_SENT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_WIRE_BYTES_RECEIVED%`` access log substitution strings for UDP tunneling flows.
- area: original_ip_detection extension
  change: |
    The :ref:`xff <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.original_ip_detection.xff.v3.XffConfig>`
    original IP detection method now supports using a list of trusted CIDRs when parsing ``x-forwarded-for``.
- area: resource_monitors
  change: |
    Added possibility to monitor CPU utilization in Linux based systems via :ref:`cpu utilization monitor
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.cpu_utilization.v3.CpuUtilizationConfig>` in overload manager.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added two new methods ``oidsPeerCertificate()`` and ``oidsLocalCertificate()`` to SSL
    connection object API :ref:`SSL connection info object <config_http_filters_lua_ssl_socket_info>`.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    Add the :ref:`rate_limits
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.local_ratelimit.v3.LocalRateLimit.rate_limits>`
    field to generate rate limit descriptors. If this field is set, the
    :ref:`VirtualHost.rate_limits <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` or
    :ref:`RouteAction.rate_limits <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.rate_limits>` fields
    will be ignored.
- area: basic_auth
  change: |
    Added support to provide an override
    :ref:`authentication_header <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.basic_auth.v3.BasicAuth.authentication_header>`
    to load Basic Auth credential.
- area: quic
