    Use one of a hard-coded set of error messages when a :ref:`HeaderMutation
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.HeaderMutation>` fails. Removing
    request-specific details allows grouping by similar failure types. Detailed
    messages remain available in debug logs.

  change: |
    Add a new quic configuration field, 'max_sessions_per_event_loop', to QuicProtocolOptions in Envoy listener.
    This allows tuning the maximum number of new QUIC sessions created within a single event loop.
    The default value is 16, preserving the previous hardcoded limit.
