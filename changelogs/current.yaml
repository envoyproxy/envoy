behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: aws_iam
  change: |
    As announced in November 2024 (see https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/37621), the
    ``grpc_credentials/aws_iam`` extension is being deleted. Any configuration referencing this extension
    will fail to load.
- area: prefix_match_map
  change: |
    :ref:`prefix_match_map <envoy_v3_api_field_config.common.matcher.v3.Matcher.MatcherTree.prefix_match_map>`
    now continues to search for a match with shorter prefix if a longer match
    does not find an action. This brings it in line with the behavior of ``matcher_list``.
    This change can temporarily be reverted by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.prefix_map_matcher_resume_after_subtree_miss`` to ``false``.
    If the old behavior is desired more permanently, this can be achieved in config by setting
    an ``on_no_match`` action that responds with 404 for each subtree.
- area: server
  change: |
    Envoy will automatically raise the soft limit on the file descriptors to the hard limit. This behavior
    can be reverted using the runtime guard ``envoy_restart_features_raise_file_limits``.
- area: build
  change: |
    Removed the clang-libstdc++ toolchain setup as this is no longer used or tested by the project.
    Consolidated clang and gcc toolchains which can be used with ``--config=clang`` or ``--config=gcc``.
    These use libc++ and libstdc++ respectively.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: lua
  change: |
    The ``metadata()`` of lua filter now will search the metadata by the :ref:`filter config name
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpFilter.name>` first.
    And if not found, it will search by the canonical name of the filter ``envoy.filters.http.lua``.
- area: grpc-json
  change: |
    Make the :ref:`gRPC JSON transcoder filter's <config_http_filters_grpc_json_reverse_transcoder>` JSON print options configurable.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Reset CSRF token when token validation fails during redirection.
    If the CSRF token cookie is present during the redirection to the authorization server, it will be validated.
    Previously, if this validation failed, the OAuth flow would fail. Now the CSRF token will simply be reset. This fixes
    the case where an HMAC secret change causes a redirect flow, but the CSRF token cookie hasn't yet expired
    causing a CSRF token validation failure.
- area: cel
  change: |
    Precompile regexes in CEL expressions. This can be disabled by setting the runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_cel_regex_precompilation`` to ``false``.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Allow ``getaddrinfo`` to be configured to run by a thread pool, controlled by :ref:`num_resolver_threads
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.network.dns_resolver.getaddrinfo.v3.GetAddrInfoDnsResolverConfig.num_resolver_threads>`.
- area: grpc-json-transcoding
  change: |
    Add SSE style message framing for streamed responses in :ref:`gRPC JSON transcoder filter <config_http_filters_grpc_json_transcoder>`.
- area: http
  change: |
   :ref:`response_headers_to_add <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.response_headers_to_add>` and
   :ref:`response_headers_to_remove <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.response_headers_to_remove>`
   will also be applied to the local responses from the ``envoy.filters.http.router`` filter.
- area: aws
  change: |
    :ref:`AwsCredentialProvider <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.common.aws.v3.AwsCredentialProvider>` now supports all defined credential
    providers, allowing complete customisation of the credential provider chain when using AWS request signing extension.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: conn_pool
  change: |
    Fixed an issue that could lead to too many connections when using
    :ref:`AutoHttpConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.AutoHttpConfig>` if the
    established connection is ``http/2`` and Envoy predicted it would have lower concurrent capacity.
- area: conn_pool
  change: |
    Fixed an issue that could lead to insufficient connections for current pending requests. If a connection starts draining while it
    has negative unused capacity (which happens if an HTTP/2 ``SETTINGS`` frame reduces allowed concurrency to below the current number
    of requests), that connection's unused capacity will be included in total pool capacity even though it is unusable because it is
    draining. This can result in not enough connections being established for current pending requests. This is most problematic for
    long-lived requests (such as streaming gRPC requests or long-poll requests) because a connection could be in the draining state
    for a long time.
- area: hcm
  change: |
    Fixes a bug where the lifetime of the ``HttpConnectionManager``'s ``ActiveStream`` can be out of sync
    with the lifetime of the codec stream.
- area: config_validation
  change: |
    Fixed an bug where the config validation server will crash when the configuration contains
    ``%CEL%`` or ``%METADATA%`` substitution formatter.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixes a bug in Envoy's HTTP/3-to-HTTP/1 proxying when a ``transfer-encoding`` header is incorrectly appended.
    Protected by runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_signal_headers_only_to_http1_backend``.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Fixes a bug where empty trusted CA file or inline string is accepted and causes Envoy to successfully validate any certificate
    chain. This fix addresses this issue by rejecting such configuration with empty value. This behavior can be reverted by setting
    the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.reject_empty_trusted_ca_file`` to ``false``.

  change: |
    Included the asterisk ``*`` in the match pattern when using the ``*`` or ``**`` operators in the URL template.
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uri_template_match_on_asterisk`` to ``false``.
- area: socket
  change: |
    Added ``network_namespace_filepath`` to ``SocketAddress``. Currently only used by listeners.

- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    ``local_ratelimit`` will return ``x-ratelimit-reset`` header when the rate limit is exceeded.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added :ref:`end_session_endpoint <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.end_session_endpoint>`
    to the ``oauth2`` filter to support OIDC RP initiated logout. This field is only used when
    ``openid`` is in the :ref:`auth_scopes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.auth_scopes>` field.
    If configured, the OAuth2 filter will redirect users to this endpoint when they access the
    :ref:`signout_path <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.signout_path>`. This allows users to
    be logged out of the Authorization server.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Added configurable :ref:`csrf_token_expires_in
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.csrf_token_expires_in>`
    and :ref:`code_verifier_token_expires_in
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.oauth2.v3.OAuth2Config.code_verifier_token_expires_in>`
    fields to the ``oauth2`` filter. Both default to ``600s`` (10 minutes) if not specified, keeping backward compatibility.
- area: load shed point
  change: |
    Added load shed point ``envoy.load_shed_points.connection_pool_new_connection`` in the connection pool, and it will not
    create new connections when Envoy is under pressure, and the pending downstream requests will be cancelled.
- area: api_key_auth
  change: |
    Added :ref:`forwarding configuration <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.api_key_auth.v3.Forwarding>`
    to the API Key Auth filter, which allows forwarding the authenticated client identity
    using a custom header, and also offers the option to remove the API key from the request
    before forwarding.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``dynamicTypedMetadata()`` on ``connectionStreamInfo()`` which could be used to access the typed metadata from
    network filters, such as the Proxy Protocol, etc.
- area: aws
  change: |
    Implementation of `IAM Roles Anywhere support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html>`_ in the
    AWS common components, providing this capability to the AWS Lambda and AWS Request Signing extensions.
- area: redis
  change: |
    ``redis_proxy`` filter now supports AWS IAM Authentication.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added matcher based router cluster specifier plugin to support selecting cluster dynamically based on a matcher tree.

    :ref:`matcher cluster specifier plugin <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.router.cluster_specifiers.matcher.v3.MatcherClusterSpecifier>`
    for more details.
- area: router
  change: |
    Added new ``refreshRouteCluster()`` method to stream filter callbacks to support refreshing the route cluster and
    need not to update the route cache. See :ref:`http route mutation <arch_overview_http_filters_route_mutation>` for
    more details.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``dynamicTypedMetadata()`` on ``streamInfo()`` which could be used to access the typed metadata from
    HTTP filters, such as the Set Metadata filter, etc.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added a new ``failure_mode_deny_percent`` field of type ``Envoy::Runtime::FractionalPercent`` attached to the rate limit filter
    to configure the failure mode for rate limit service errors in runtime.
    It acts as an override for the existing ``failure_mode_deny`` field in the filter config.
