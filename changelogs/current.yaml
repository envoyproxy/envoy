behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Removed support for (long deprecated) opentracing.  See `issue 27401
    <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27401>`_ for details.
- area: stats scoped_rds
  change: |
    Added new tag extraction so that scoped rds stats have their :ref:'scope_route_config_name
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_config/route/v3/scoped_route>' and stat prefix extracted.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: command line options
  change: |
    :option:`--enable-fine-grain-logging` and :option:`--component-log-level` were incompatible in that one
    would make the other ineffective. Setting both options at once is now an error, to reduce potential confusion.
- area: tcp
  change: |
    Added support for :ref:`connection_pool_per_downstream_connection
    <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.connection_pool_per_downstream_connection>` flag in tcp connection pool.
- area: http3
  change: |
    The ACCEPT_UNTRUSTED option now works more consistently for HTTP/3 requests. This change is
    guarded by ``envoy.reloadable_features.extend_h3_accept_untrusted``.
- area: http3
  change: |
    HTTP/3 alt-svc headers will now be respected from IP-address-based hostnames. This change is
    guarded by runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_alt_svc_for_ips``.
- area: lua
  change: |
    When Lua script executes httpCall, backpressure is exercised when receiving body from downstream client. This behavior can be reverted
    by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.lua_flow_control_while_http_call`` to false.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: dns
  change: |
    The DNS filter no longer returns FORMERR if a message has an ID of 0.
- area: quic
  change: |
    Fixes access log formatter %CONNECTION_ID% for QUIC connections.
- area: c-ares
  change: |
    Applying a C-ares patch to fix DNS resoultion by the Google gRPC library.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Fixed fail-open behavior of the :ref:`failure_mode_allow config option
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.failure_mode_allow>`
    when a grpc external authz server is used.
    The behavior can be enabled by ``envoy_reloadable_features_process_ext_authz_grpc_error_codes_as_errors``.
- area: websocket
  change: |
    Fixed a bug where the websocket upgrade filter would not take into account per-filter configs.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Add runtime guard for timeout error code 504 Gateway Timeout that is returned to downstream. If runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.ext_proc_timeout_error`` is set to false, old error code 500 Internal Server Error will be returned.

new_features:
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added :ref:`prefer_client_ciphers
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.DownstreamTlsContext.prefer_client_ciphers>`
    to support enabling client cipher preference instead of server's for TLS handshakes.
- area: ext_authz
  change: |
    Added config field
    :ref:`filter_metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.filter_metadata>`
    for injecting arbitrary data to the filter state for logging.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    added %UPSTREAM_CLUSTER_RAW% access log formatter to log the original upstream cluster name, regardless of whether
    ``alt_stat_name`` is set.
- area: formatter
  change: |
    Added full feature absl::FormatTime() support to the DateFormatter. This allows the timepoint formatters (like
    ``%START_TIME%``) to use ``%E#S``, ``%E*S``, ``%E#f`` and ``%E*f`` to format the subsecond part of the timepoint.
- area: sockets
  change: |
    Added socket ``type`` field for specifying a socket type to apply the socket option to under :ref:`SocketOption
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.SocketOption>`. If not specified, the socket option will be applied to all socket
    types.
- area: tls
  change: |
    Added an extension point :ref:`custom_tls_certificate_selector
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CommonTlsContext.custom_tls_certificate_selector>`
    to allow overriding TLS certificate selection behavior.
    An extension can select certificate base on the incoming SNI, in both sync and async mode.
- area: matching
  change: |
    Added dynamic metadata matcher support :ref:`Dynamic metadata input <extension_envoy.matching.inputs.dynamic_metadata>`
    and :ref:`Dynamic metadata input matcher <extension_envoy.matching.matchers.metadata_matcher>`.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Added the ability to modify :ref:`hits_addend <envoy_v3_api_field_service.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitRequest.hits_addend>`
    by setting by setting filter state value ``envoy.ratelimit.hits_addend`` to the desired value.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    Added new access log command operators ``%START_TIME_LOCAL%`` and ``%EMIT_TIME_LOCAL%``,
    similar to  ``%START_TIME%`` and ``%EMIT_TIME%``, but use local time zone.
- area: dns
  change: |
    Prefer using IPv6 address when addresses from both families are available.
    Can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.prefer_ipv6_dns_on_macos`` to false.
- area: rbac
  change: |
    Added :ref:`delay_deny <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.rbac.v3.RBAC>` to support deny connection after
    the configured duration.
