- area: router
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.shadow_policy_inherit_trace_sampling`` and legacy code paths.
- area: dynamic_forward_proxy
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.avoid_dfp_cluster_removal_on_cds_update`` and legacy code paths.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Removed runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth2_use_refresh_token`` and legacy code paths.

new_features:
- area: health_check
  change: |
    Added support for request payloads in HTTP health checks. The ``send`` field in ``HttpHealthCheck`` can now be
    used to specify a request body to be sent during health checking. This feature supports both hex-encoded text
    and binary payloads, similar to TCP health checks. The payload can only be used with HTTP methods that support
    request bodies (POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS). Methods that must not have request bodies (GET, HEAD, DELETE, TRACE)
    are validated and will throw an error if combined with payloads. The implementation is optimized to process the
    payload once during configuration and reuse it for all health check requests. See :ref:`HttpHealthCheck
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck>` for configuration details.
    Upgraded Envoy to build with C++20; Envoy developers can use C++20 features now.
- area: router_check_tool
  change: |
    Added support for testing routes with :ref:`dynamic metadata matchers <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteMatch.dynamic_metadata>`
    in the router check tool. The tool now accepts a ``dynamic_metadata`` field in test input to set metadata
    that can be matched by route configuration. This allows comprehensive testing of routes that depend on
    dynamic metadata for routing decisions.
- area: redis
  change: |
    Added support for ``scan`` and ``info``.
- area: http
  change: |
    Added :ref:`x-envoy-original-host <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-original-host>` that
    is used to record the original host header value before it is mutated by the router filter.
- area: stateful_session
  change: |
    Supports envelope stateful session extension to keep the existing session header value
    from upstream server. See :ref:`mode
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.http.stateful_session.envelope.v3.EnvelopeSessionState>`
    for more details.
- area: transport tap
  change: |
    Add counter in transport tap for streaming and buffer trace.
    streamed trace can sent tapped message based on configured size.
- area: load_balancing
  change: |
    Added Override Host Load Balancing policy. See
    :ref:`load balancing policies overview <arch_overview_load_balancing_policies>` for more details.
- area: lua
  change: |
    Added a new ``filterState()`` on ``streamInfo()`` which provides access to filter state objects stored during request processing.
    This allows Lua scripts to retrieve string, boolean, and numeric values stored by various filters for use in routing decisions,
    header modifications, and other processing logic. See :ref:`Filter State API <config_http_filters_lua_stream_info_filter_state_wrapper>`
    for more details.
- area: ratelimit
  change: |
    Add the :ref:`rate_limits
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimit.rate_limits>`
    field to generate rate limit descriptors. If this field is set, the
    :ref:`VirtualHost.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` or
    :ref:`RouteAction.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RouteAction.rate_limits>` fields will be ignored. However,
    :ref:`RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ratelimit.v3.RateLimitPerRoute.rate_limits>`
    will take precedence over this field.
