  change: |
    Fixed fail-open behaviour of the :ref:`failure_mode_allow config option
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.failure_mode_allow>`
    when a grpc external authz server is used.
    The behaviour can be enabled by ``envoy_reloadable_features_process_ext_authz_grpc_error_codes_as_errors``.
