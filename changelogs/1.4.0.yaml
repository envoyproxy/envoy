changes:
- area: mac
  change: |
    macOS is :repo:`now supported <v1.5:/bazel#quick-start-bazel-build-for-developers>`. (A few features are missing such as
    hot restart and original destination routing).

  change: |
    Added /routes admin endpoint.
- area: flow_control

- area: deprecation
  change: |
    Several features are `deprecated as of the 1.4.0 release
    <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.4.0/DEPRECATED.md>`_. They will be removed at the beginning of the 1.5.0
    release cycle. We explicitly call out that the ``HttpFilterConfigFactory`` filter API has been deprecated in favor of
    ``NamedHttpFilterConfigFactory``.
- area: envoy
  change: |
    Many small bug fixes and performance improvements not listed.

deprecated:
- area: options
  change: |
    Config option ``statsd_local_udp_port`` has been deprecated and has been replaced with ``statsd_udp_ip_address``.
- area: http_filters
  change: |
    ``HttpFilterConfigFactory`` filter API has been deprecated in favor of ``NamedHttpFilterConfigFactory``.
- area: config
  change: |
    Config option ``http_codec_options`` has been deprecated and has been replaced with ``http2_settings``.
- area: logging
  change: |
    The following log macros have been deprecated: ``log_trace``, ``log_debug``, ``conn_log``, ``conn_log_info``,
    ``conn_log_debug``, ``conn_log_trace``, ``stream_log``, ``stream_log_info``, ``stream_log_debug``, ``stream_log_trace``.
    For replacements, please see `logger.h <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/source/common/common/logger.h>`_.
- area: streaming
  change: |
    The connectionId() and ssl() callbacks of StreamFilterCallbacks have been deprecated and replaced with a more general
    connection() callback, which, when not returning a nullptr, can be used to get the connection id and SSL connection from
    the returned Connection object pointer.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    The protobuf stub gRPC support via ``Grpc::RpcChannelImpl`` is now replaced with ``Grpc::AsyncClientImpl``. This no
    longer uses ``protoc`` generated stubs but instead utilizes C++ template generation of the RPC stubs.
    ``Grpc::AsyncClientImpl`` supports streaming, in addition to the previous unary, RPCs.
- area: filters
  change: |
    The direction of network and HTTP filters in the configuration will be ignored from 1.4.0 and later removed from the
    configuration in the v2 APIs. Filter direction is now implied at the C++ type level. The ``type()`` methods on the
    ``NamedNetworkFilterConfigFactory`` and ``NamedHttpFilterConfigFactory`` interfaces have been removed to reflect this.
