# Support Rotation

Envoy Mobile has a support rotation system to ensure that discussions,
issues and pull requests are handled in a timely manner from someone who
works on Envoy Mobile at Lyft.

## Who's this week's current support maintainer?

The current support maintainer's GitHub username is defined
[here](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-mobile/blob/main/.github/lyft_maintainers.yml#L1).

## Responsibilities

* **Monitor GitHub Issues & Pull Requests:** Ensure that discussions on
  GitHub are engaged with in a prompt manner.
* **Monitor Slack:** Engage with Slack discussions in the Envoy slack
  org ([#envoy-mobile](https://envoyproxy.slack.com/archives/CKQ2LK23G),
  [#envoy-mobile-engflow-ci](https://envoyproxy.slack.com/archives/C02QMNG92A3)).

Even though there is no concrete SLA, the support maintainer will make a
reasonable effort to engage with discussions within 1 business day.

## Why is the rotation limited to Lyft employees?

Envoy Mobile is a project maintained by contributors from multiple
companies, as highlighted in [OWNERS.md](../OWNERS.md), but as the
project grows we believe it will be helpful to have a point of contact
within a company that has been using Envoy Mobile in production.
