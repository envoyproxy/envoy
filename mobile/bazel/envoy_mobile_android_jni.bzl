# This is the magic function which helps get the name of the native library
# from the native dependency. In general, the bazel cc_binary rules will
# output a binary based on the target name. This macro just infers the output
# so file name.
#
# The main functionality of this method is used for integration java/android
# testing. Bazel itself doesn't play well with different genrules outputting
# the same output. In this project there's 3 types of artifacts we end up
# using: envoy's aar, integration tests with just vanilla jvm, integration
# tests with android. Each of these require a different so file built which
# means that Bazel will have to output 3 types of so files with different names.

# Basic macro which uses a genrule to generate a jnilib file from an so file
#
# The native dep passed in should be the cc_binary target of the name
# lib{}.so since linux platforms expect the .so file to be named in that form.
# The resulting output will be lib{}.jnilib for the OS X platforms.

# envoy_mobile_so_to_jni_lib(
#     name = "java_jni_lib.jnilib",
#     native_dep = "libjava_jni_lib.so",
