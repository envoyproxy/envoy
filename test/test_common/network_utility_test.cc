// this too long else we'll eventually run out of ephemeral ports.
//
// Tested: IPv4 with --gtest_repeats=1000 and kLimit=1000 on Ubuntu with docker.
// Result: Zero failures, presumably because of the randomization of the address.
//
// Tested: IPv6 --gtest_repeats=1000 and kLimit=50 on Ubuntu with docker.
// Result: In about 5% of runs, two of the 50 allocated ports were the same, though not
//         more than that.
// The test is DISABLED as we don't want the occasional expected collisions to cause problems.
