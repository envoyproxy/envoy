# Generating custom geoip databases

Envoy uses the [Google Test framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) for
tests, including
[Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/README.md) for
mocks and matchers. See the documentation on those pages for information on the
various classes, macros, and matchers that Envoy uses from those frameworks.
