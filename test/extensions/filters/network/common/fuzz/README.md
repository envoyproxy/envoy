Network filters need to be fuzzed. Filters come in two flavors, each with their own fuzzer. Read filters should be added into the [Generic ReadFilter Fuzzer](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/test/extensions/filters/network/common/fuzz/network_readfilter_fuzz_test.cc). Write Filters should added into the [Generic WriteFilter Fuzzer](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/test/extensions/filters/network/common/fuzz/network_writefilter_fuzz_test.cc). Some filters are both raed and write filters: They should be added into both fuzzers.
To add a new filter into generic network level filter fuzzers, see the [doc](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/source/docs/network_filter_fuzzing.md).
