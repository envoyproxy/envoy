==========================

Changes
-------

* http: fixed CVE-2019-18801 by allocating sufficient memory for request headers.
* http: fixed CVE-2019-18802 by implementing stricter validation of HTTP/1 headers.
* http: trim LWS at the end of header keys, for correct HTTP/1.1 header parsing.
* http: added strict authority checking. This can be reversed temporarily by setting the runtime feature `envoy.reloadable_features.strict_authority_validation` to false.
* route config: fixed CVE-2019-18838 by checking for presence of host/path headers.
