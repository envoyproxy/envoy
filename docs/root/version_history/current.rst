Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* http: set the default :ref:`lazy headermap threshold <arch_overview_http_header_map_settings>` to 3,
  which defines the minimal number of headers in a request/response/trailers required for using a
  dictionary in addition to the list. Setting the `envoy.http.headermap.lazy_map_min_size` runtime
  feature to a non-negative number will override the default value.
