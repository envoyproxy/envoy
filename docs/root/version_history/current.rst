1.20.0 (Pending)
================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* config: configuration files ending in .yml now load as YAML.
* config: configuration file extensions now ignore case when deciding the file type. E.g., .JSON file load as JSON.
* config: reduced log level for "Unable to establish new stream" xDS logs to debug. The log level
  for "gRPC config stream closed" is now reduced to debug when the status is ``Ok`` or has been
  retriable (``DeadlineExceeded``, ``ResourceExhausted``, or ``Unavailable``) for less than 30
  seconds.
* grpc: gRPC async client can be cached and shared accross filter instances in the same thread, this feature is turned off by default, can be turned on by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_grpc_async_client_cache`` to true.
* http: correct the use of the ``x-forwarded-proto`` header and the ``:scheme`` header. Where they differ
  (which is rare) ``:scheme`` will now be used for serving redirect URIs and cached content. This behavior
  can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``correct_scheme_and_xfp`` to false.
* http: set the default :ref:`lazy headermap threshold <arch_overview_http_header_map_settings>` to 3,
  which defines the minimal number of headers in a request/response/trailers required for using a
  dictionary in addition to the list. Setting the `envoy.http.headermap.lazy_map_min_size` runtime
  feature to a non-negative number will override the default value.
* listener: added the :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>`
  field and changed the default for reuse_port from false to true, as the feature is now well
  supported on the majority of production Linux kernels in use. The default change is aware of hot
  restart, as otherwise the change would not be backwards compatible between restarts. This means
  that hot restarting on to a new binary will retain the default of false until the binary undergoes
  a full restart. To retain the previous behavior, either explicitly set the new configuration
  field to false, or set the runtime feature flag `envoy.reloadable_features.listener_reuse_port_default_enabled`
  to false. As part of this change, the use of reuse_port for TCP listeners on both macOS and
  Windows has been disabled due to suboptimal behavior. See the field documentation for more
  information.

Bug Fixes
---------
*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

* access log: fix `%UPSTREAM_CLUSTER%` when used in http upstream access logs. Previously, it was always logging as an unset value.
* cluster: delete pools when they're idle to fix unbounded memory use when using PROXY protocol upstream with tcp_proxy. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.conn_pool_delete_when_idle`` runtime guard to false.
* xray: fix the AWS X-Ray tracer bug where span's error, fault and throttle information was not reported properly as per the `AWS X-Ray documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html>`_. Before this fix, server error was reported under 'annotations' section of the segment data.

Removed Config or Runtime
-------------------------
*Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

* http: removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.http_upstream_wait_connect_response`` runtime guard and legacy code paths.
* http: removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_preconnect`` runtime guard and legacy code paths.
* listener: removed ``envoy.reloadable_features.disable_tls_inspector_injection`` runtime guard and legacy code paths.

New Features
------------
* bootstrap: added :ref:`inline_headers <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.inline_headers>` in the bootstrap to make custom inline headers bootstrap configurable.
* http: added :ref:`string_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.string_match>` in the header matcher.
* http: added support for :ref:`max_requests_per_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.max_requests_per_connection>` for both upstream and downstream connections.

* jwt_authn: added support for :ref:`Jwt Cache <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.jwt_authn.v3.JwtProvider.jwt_cache_config>` and its size can be specified by :ref:`jwt_cache_size <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.jwt_authn.v3.JwtCacheConfig.jwt_cache_size>`.

Deprecated
----------
* cluster: :ref:`max_requests_per_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.max_requests_per_connection>` is deprecated in favor of :ref:`max_requests_per_connection <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.max_requests_per_connection>`.
* http: the HeaderMatcher fields :ref:`exact_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.exact_match>`, :ref:`safe_regex_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.safe_regex_match>`,
  :ref:`prefix_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.prefix_match>`, :ref:`suffix_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.suffix_match>` and
  :ref:`contains_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.contains_match>` are deprecated by :ref:`string_match <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.string_match>`.
* listener: :ref:`reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.reuse_port>` has been
  deprecated in favor of :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>`.
  At the same time, the default has been changed from false to true. See above for more information.
