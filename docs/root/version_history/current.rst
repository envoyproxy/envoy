1.18.0 (Pending)
================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* upstream: host weight changes now cause a full load balancer rebuild as opposed to happening
  atomically inline. This change has been made to support load balancer pre-computation of data
  structures based on host weight, but may have performance implications if host weight changes
  are very frequent. This change can be disabled by setting the `envoy.reloadable_features.upstream_host_weight_change_causes_rebuild`
  feature flag to false. If setting this flag to false is required in a deployment please open an
  issue against the project.

Bug Fixes
---------
*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

* active http health checks: properly handles HTTP/2 GOAWAY frames from the upstream. Previously a GOAWAY frame due to a graceful listener drain could cause improper failed health checks due to streams being refused by the upstream on a connection that is going away. To revert to old GOAWAY handling behavior, set the runtime feature `envoy.reloadable_features.health_check.graceful_goaway_handling` to false.

Removed Config or Runtime
-------------------------
*Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

* access_logs: removed legacy unbounded access logs and runtime guard `envoy.reloadable_features.disallow_unbounded_access_logs`.

New Features
------------
* access log: added the :ref:`formatters <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SubstitutionFormatString.formatters>` extension point for custom formatters (command operators).
* tcp_proxy: add support for converting raw TCP streams into HTTP/1.1 CONNECT requests. See :ref:`upgrade documentation <tunneling-tcp-over-http>` for details.
* config: Add `envoy.features.disallow_deprecated_features` runtime flag, which matches the behaviour of compile-time flag `ENVOY_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_FEATURES`, i.e. use of deprecated fields will cause a crash.

Deprecated
----------
