Windows based Front proxy
=========================

.. sidebar:: Requirements

   .. include:: _include/docker-env-setup-link.rst

To get a flavor of what Envoy has to offer on Windows, we are releasing a
`docker compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_ sandbox that deploys a front Envoy and a
couple of services (simple Flask apps) colocated with a running service Envoy.

The three containers will be deployed inside a virtual network called ``envoymesh``.

Below you can see a graphic showing the docker compose deployment:

.. image:: /_static/docker_compose_front_proxy.svg
  :width: 100%

All incoming requests are routed via the front Envoy, which is acting as a reverse proxy sitting on
the edge of the ``envoymesh`` network. Port ``8080``, ``8443``, and ``8001`` are exposed by docker
compose (see :download:`docker-compose.yaml <_include/front-proxy/docker-compose.yaml>`) to handle
``HTTP``, ``HTTPS`` calls to the services and requests to ``/admin`` respectively.

Moreover, notice that all traffic routed by the front Envoy to the service containers is actually
routed to the service Envoys (routes setup in :download:`front-envoy.yaml <_include/front-proxy/front-envoy.yaml>`).

In turn the service Envoys route the request to the Flask app via the loopback
address (routes setup in :download:`service-envoy.yaml <_include/front-proxy/service-envoy.yaml>`). This
setup illustrates the advantage of running service Envoys collocated with your services: all
requests are handled by the service Envoy, and efficiently routed to your services.

Step 1: Start all of our containers
***********************************

Change to the ``examples/front-proxy`` directory.

.. code-block:: console

    PS> $PWD
    D:\envoy\examples\win32-front-proxy
    PS> docker-compose build --pull
    PS> docker-compose up -d
    PS> docker-compose ps
        Name                            Command               State                                         Ports
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    envoy-front-proxy_front-envoy_1   powershell.exe ./start_env ... Up      10000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8003->8003/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8443->8443/tcp
    envoy-front-proxy_service1_1      powershell.exe ./start_ser ... Up      10000/tcp
    envoy-front-proxy_service2_1      powershell.exe ./start_ser ... Up      10000/tcp

Step 2: Test Envoy's routing capabilities
*****************************************

You can now send a request to both services via the ``front-envoy``.

For ``service1``:

.. code-block:: console

    PS> curl -v localhost:8080/service/1
    *   Trying ::1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
    > GET /service/1 HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > User-Agent: curl/7.55.1
    > Accept: */*
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 92
    < server: envoy
    < date: Wed, 05 May 2021 05:55:55 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 18
    <
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 1)! hostname: 8a45bba91d83 resolvedhostname: 172.30.97.237
    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact

For ``service2``:

.. code-block:: console

    PS> curl -v localhost:8080/service/2
    *   Trying ::1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
    > GET /service/2 HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > User-Agent: curl/7.55.1
    > Accept: */*
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 93
    < server: envoy
    < date: Wed, 05 May 2021 05:57:03 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 14
    <
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 2)! hostname: 51e28eb3c8b8 resolvedhostname: 172.30.109.113
    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact

Notice that each request, while sent to the front Envoy, was correctly routed to the respective
application.

We can also use ``HTTPS`` to call services behind the front Envoy. For example, calling ``service1``:

.. code-block:: console

    PS> curl https://localhost:8443/service/1 -k -v
    *   Trying ::1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8443 (#0)
    * schannel: SSL/TLS connection with localhost port 8443 (step 1/3)
    * schannel: disabled server certificate revocation checks
    * schannel: verifyhost setting prevents Schannel from comparing the supplied target name with the subject names in server certificates.
    * schannel: sending initial handshake data: sending 171 bytes...
    * schannel: sent initial handshake data: sent 171 bytes

    * schannel: failed to receive handshake, need more data
    * schannel: SSL/TLS connection with localhost port 8443 (step 2/3)
    * schannel: encrypted data got 1081

    * schannel: SSL/TLS connection with localhost port 8443 (step 2/3)
    * schannel: encrypted data got 258
    * schannel: encrypted data buffer: offset 258 length 4096
    * schannel: SSL/TLS handshake complete
    * schannel: SSL/TLS connection with localhost port 8443 (step 3/3)
    * schannel: stored credential handle in session cache
    > GET /service/1 HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8443
    > User-Agent: curl/7.55.1

    Hello from behind Envoy (service 1)! hostname: 8a45bba91d83 resolvedhostname: 172.30.97.237
    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact

Step 3: Test Envoy's load balancing capabilities
************************************************

Now let's scale up our ``service1`` nodes to demonstrate the load balancing abilities of Envoy:

.. code-block:: console

    PS> docker-compose scale service1=3
    Creating and starting example_service1_2 ... done
    Creating and starting example_service1_3 ... done

Now if we send a request to ``service1`` multiple times, the front Envoy will load balance the
requests by doing a round robin of the three ``service1`` machines:

.. code-block:: console

    PS> curl -v localhost:8080/service/1
    *   Trying ::1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
    > GET /service/1 HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > User-Agent: curl/7.55.1
    > Accept: */*
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 93
    < server: envoy
    < date: Wed, 05 May 2021 05:58:40 GMT

    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
    PS> curl -v localhost:8080/service/1
    *   Trying ::1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
    > GET /service/1 HTTP/1.1

    > User-Agent: curl/7.55.1
    > Accept: */*
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 91
    < server: envoy
    < date: Wed, 05 May 2021 05:58:43 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 11
    <
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 1)! hostname: 41e1141eebf4 resolvedhostname: 172.30.96.11

    PS> curl -v localhost:8080/service/1
    *   Trying ::1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
    > GET /service/1 HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:8080
    > User-Agent: curl/7.55.1
    > Accept: */*
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    < content-length: 92
    < server: envoy
    < date: Wed, 05 May 2021 05:58:44 GMT
    < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 7
    <
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 1)! hostname: 8a45bba91d83 resolvedhostname: 172.30.97.237
    * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact

Step 4: Enter containers and curl services
******************************************

In addition of using ``curl`` from your host machine, you can also enter the
containers themselves and ``curl`` from inside them. To enter a container you
can use ``docker-compose exec <container_name> /bin/bash``. For example we can
enter the ``front-envoy`` container, and ``curl`` for services locally:

.. code-block:: console

    PS> docker-compose exec front-envoy powershell
    PS C:\> (curl -UseBasicParsing http://localhost:8080/service/1).Content
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 1)! hostname: 41e1141eebf4 resolvedhostname: 172.30.96.11

    PS C:\> (curl -UseBasicParsing http://localhost:8080/service/1).Content
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 1)! hostname: 8a45bba91d83 resolvedhostname: 172.30.97.237

    PS C:\> (curl -UseBasicParsing http://localhost:8080/service/1).Content
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 1)! hostname: 8d2359ee21a8 resolvedhostname: 172.30.101.143


Step 5: Enter container and curl admin interface
************************************************

When Envoy runs it also attaches an ``admin`` to your desired port.

In the example configs the admin listener is bound to port ``8001``.

We can ``curl`` it to gain useful information:

- :ref:`/server_info <operations_admin_interface_server_info>` provides information about the Envoy version you are running.
- :ref:`/stats <operations_admin_interface_stats>` provides statistics about the  Envoy server.

In the example we can enter the ``front-envoy`` container to query admin:

.. code-block:: console

    PS> docker-compose exec front-envoy powershell
    PS C:\> (curl http://localhost:8003/server_info -UseBasicParsing).Content

.. code-block:: json

Notice that we can get the number of members of upstream clusters, number of requests fulfilled by
them, information about http ingress, and a plethora of other useful stats.
