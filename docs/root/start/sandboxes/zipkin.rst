Zipkin tracing

   :ref:`curl <start_sandboxes_setup_curl>`
        Used to make ``HTTP`` requests.

The Zipkin tracing sandbox demonstrates Envoy's :ref:`request tracing <arch_overview_tracing>`
capabilities using `Zipkin <https://zipkin.io/>`_ as the tracing provider.

In this example, 2 backend services are provided:

- ``service-1``
- ``service-2``

3 Envoy proxies are also provided to route requests to them:

- ``envoy-front-proxy`` (:download:`envoy-front-proxy.yaml <_include/zipkin/envoy-front-proxy.yaml>`)
- ``envoy-1`` (:download:`envoy-1.yaml <_include/zipkin/envoy-1.yaml>`)
- ``envoy-2`` (:download:`envoy-2.yaml <_include/zipkin/envoy-2.yaml>`)

Of these services, only the Envoy ``front-proxy`` service is exposed outside of the
:download:`composition <_include/zipkin/docker-compose.yaml>`, on port ``10000``.

For ``service-1``, requests are routed based on the request path ``trace/1``, as follows:

    User -> Envoy(``envoy-front-proxy``) -> Envoy(``envoy-1``) -> ``service-1``

For ``service-2``, requests are routed based on the request path ``trace/2`` as follows:

    User -> Envoy(``envoy-front-proxy``) -> Envoy(``envoy-1``) -> Envoy(``envoy-2``) -> ``service-2``

All Envoy proxies are configured to collect request traces, as can be seen in their configurations,
propagating the spans (parent/child/shared context) generated by the Zipkin tracer to a Zipkin cluster.

Each span records the latency of upstream API calls as well as information
needed to correlate the span with other related spans (e.g., the trace ID).

The Zipkin collector provides a web UI for viewing the collected traces on port ``9411``.

Step 1: Build the sandbox
*************************

Change directory to ``examples/zipkin`` in the Envoy repository.

To build this sandbox example, and start the example services run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pwd
    envoy/examples/zipkin
    $ docker-compose pull
    $ docker-compose up --build -d
    $ docker-compose ps

                Name                          Command             State            Ports
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    zipkin_envoy-1_1             /docker-entrypoint.sh /usr ... Up             10000/tcp
    zipkin_envoy-2_1             /docker-entrypoint.sh /usr ... Up             10000/tcp
    zipkin_envoy-front-proxy_1   /docker-entrypoint.sh /usr ... Up             0.0.0.0:10000->10000/tcp
    zipkin_service-1_1           python3 /code/service.py       Up (healthy)
    zipkin_service-2_1           python3 /code/service.py       Up (healthy)
    zipkin_zipkin_1              start-zipkin                   Up (healthy)   9410/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9411->9411/tcp

Step 2: Make a request to ``service-1``
***************************************

Now send a request to ``service-1``, by calling http://localhost:10000/trace/1.

This will be routed via 2 of the Envoy proxies:

- ``front-proxy``
- ``envoy-1``

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl localhost:10000/trace/1
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 1)!

Step 3: Make a request to ``service-2``
***************************************

Now send a request to ``service-2``, by calling http://localhost:10000/trace/2.

This will be routed via all 3 of the Envoy proxies:

- ``front-proxy``
- ``envoy-1``
- ``envoy-2``

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl localhost:10000/trace/2
    Hello from behind Envoy (service 2)!

Step 4: View the traces in Zipkin UI
************************************

Point your browser to http://localhost:9411 .

You should see the Zipkin dashboard.

Click the ``RUN QUERY`` button, and expand the traces by clicking ``EXPAND ALL``.

Here you can explore the paths taken by the requests, as well as the latency incurred at each hop,
and other contextual information.

Note that Zipkin identifies the Envoy proxies by the name provided in the bootstrap ``node/cluster`` configuration.

You can also explore the Zipkin dependency UI to view relationships between nodes and the path of traces.
