Getting Started
===============

This section gets you started with a very simple configuration and provides some example configurations.

The fastest way to get started using Envoy is :ref:`installing pre-built binaries <install_binaries>`.
You can also :ref:`build it <building>` from source.

These examples use the :ref:`v3 Envoy API <envoy_v3_api_reference>`.
