Configuration: Static
=====================

To start Envoy with static configuration, you will need to specify :ref:`listeners <start_quick_start_static_listeners>`
and :ref:`clusters <start_quick_start_static_clusters>` as
:ref:`static_resources <start_quick_start_static_static_resources>`.

You can also add an :ref:`admin <start_quick_start_admin>` section if you wish to monitor Envoy
or retrieve stats.

The following sections walk through the static configuration provided in the
:download:`demo configuration file <_include/envoy-demo.yaml>` used as the default in the Envoy Docker container.

.. _start_quick_start_static_static_resources:

``static_resources``
--------------------

The :ref:`static_resources <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.static_resources>` contain
everything that is configured statically when Envoy starts, as opposed to dynamically at runtime.

.. _start_quick_start_static_listeners:

``listeners``
-------------

The example configures a :ref:`listener <envoy_v3_api_file_envoy/config/listener/v3/listener.proto>`
on port ``10000``.

All paths are matched and routed to the ``service_envoyproxy_io``
:ref:`cluster <start_quick_start_static_clusters>`.

.. _start_quick_start_static_clusters:

``clusters``
------------

The ``service_envoyproxy_io`` :ref:`cluster <envoy_v3_api_file_envoy/config/cluster/v3/cluster.proto>`
proxies over ``TLS`` to https://www.envoyproxy.io.
