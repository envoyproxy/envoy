  :ref:`max_buffer_size_before_flush <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.redis_proxy.v2.RedisProxy.ConnPoolSettings.max_buffer_size_before_flush>` to batch commands together until the encoder buffer hits a certain size, and
  :ref:`buffer_flush_timeout <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.redis_proxy.v2.RedisProxy.ConnPoolSettings.buffer_flush_timeout>` to control how quickly the buffer is flushed if it is not full.
* redis: added auth support :ref:`downstream_auth_password <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.redis_proxy.v2.RedisProxy.downstream_auth_password>` for downstream client authentication, and :ref:`auth_password <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.redis_proxy.v2.RedisProtocolOptions.auth_password>` to configure authentication passwords for upstream server clusters.

  in full by the router. This ensures that the per try timeout does not account for slow
  downstreams and that will not start before the global timeout.
* router: added :ref:`RouteAction's auto_host_rewrite_header <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite_header>` to allow upstream host header substitution with some other header's value
* router: added support for UPSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS :ref:`header formatter
  <config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers>`.

  on the endpoints.
* tools: added :repo:`proto <test/tools/router_check/validation.proto>` support for :ref:`router check tool <install_tools_route_table_check_tool>` tests.
* tracing: add trace sampling configuration to the route, to override the route level.
* upstream: added :ref:`upstream_cx_pool_overflow <config_cluster_manager_cluster_stats>` for the connection pool circuit breaker.
* upstream: an EDS management server can now force removal of a host that is still passing active
  health checking by first marking the host as failed via EDS health check and subsequently removing
  it in a future update. This is a mechanism to work around a race condition in which an EDS
  implementation may remove a host before it has stopped passing active HC, thus causing the host
  to become stranded until a future update.
* upstream: added :ref:`an option <envoy_api_field_Cluster.CommonLbConfig.ignore_new_hosts_until_first_hc>`
  that allows ignoring new hosts for the purpose of load balancing calculations until they have
  been health checked for the first time.

* upstream: added possibility to override fallback_policy per specific selector in :ref:`subset load balancer <arch_overview_load_balancer_subsets>`.
* upstream: the :ref:`logical DNS cluster <arch_overview_service_discovery_types_logical_dns>` now
  displays the current resolved IP address in admin output instead of 0.0.0.0.

  :ref:`port_redirect <envoy_api_field_route.RedirectAction.port_redirect>` to define the respective
  scheme and port rewriting RedirectAction.
* router: when :ref:`max_grpc_timeout <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.max_grpc_timeout>`
  is set, Envoy will now add or update the grpc-timeout header to reflect Envoy's expected timeout.
* router: per try timeouts now starts when an upstream stream is ready instead of when the request has
  been fully decoded by Envoy.
* router: added support for not retrying :ref:`rate limited requests<config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-ratelimited>`. Rate limit filter now sets the :ref:`x-envoy-ratelimited<config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-ratelimited>`
  header so the rate limited requests that may have been retried earlier will not be retried with this change.
* router: added support for enabling upgrades on a :ref:`per-route <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.upgrade_configs>` basis.

  scaling locality weights by number of hosts removed by subset lb predicates.
* upstream: changed how load calculation for :ref:`priority levels<arch_overview_load_balancing_priority_levels>` and :ref:`panic thresholds<arch_overview_load_balancing_panic_threshold>` interact. As long as normalized total health is 100% panic thresholds are disregarded.
* upstream: changed the default hash for :ref:`ring hash <envoy_api_msg_Cluster.RingHashLbConfig>` from std::hash to `xxHash <https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash>`_.
* upstream: when using active health checking and STRICT_DNS with several addresses that resolve
  to the same hosts, Envoy will now health check each host independently.

1.8.0 (Oct 4, 2018)

  <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout>`. This applies at both :ref:`connection manager
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`
  and :ref:`per-route granularity <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout>`. The timeout
  defaults to 5 minutes; if you have other timeouts (e.g. connection idle timeout, upstream
  response per-retry) that are longer than this in duration, you may want to consider setting a
  non-default per-stream idle timeout.
* http: added upstream_rq_completed counter for :ref:`total requests completed <config_cluster_manager_cluster_stats_dynamic_http>` to dynamic HTTP counters.

  dynamic table size of both: encoder and decoder.
* http: added support for removing request headers using :ref:`request_headers_to_remove
  <envoy_api_field_route.Route.request_headers_to_remove>`.
* http: added support for a :ref:`delayed close timeout<envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.delayed_close_timeout>` to mitigate race conditions when closing connections to downstream HTTP clients. The timeout defaults to 1 second.

  upstream cluster specified by the SNI value presented by the client during a TLS handshake.
* proxy_protocol: added support for HAProxy Proxy Protocol v2 (AF_INET/AF_INET6 only).
* ratelimit: added support for :repo:`api/envoy/service/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto`.
  Lyft's reference implementation of the `ratelimit <https://github.com/lyft/ratelimit>`_ service also supports the data-plane-api proto as of v1.1.0.
  Envoy can use either proto to send client requests to a ratelimit server with the use of the
  `use_data_plane_proto` boolean flag in the ratelimit configuration.
  Support for the legacy proto `source/common/ratelimit/ratelimit.proto` is deprecated and will be removed at the start of the 1.9.0 release cycle.

  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-client-cert` header.
* http: local responses to gRPC requests are now sent as trailers-only gRPC responses instead of plain HTTP responses.
  Notably the HTTP response code is always "200" in this case, and the gRPC error code is carried in "grpc-status"
  header, optionally accompanied with a text message in "grpc-message" header.

* router: the behavior of per-try timeouts have changed in the case where a portion of the response has
  already been proxied downstream when the timeout occurs. Previously, the response would be reset
  leading to either an HTTP/2 reset or an HTTP/1 closed connection and a partial response. Now, the
  timeout will be ignored and the response will continue to proxy up to the global request timeout.

  :ref:`verify_certificate_spki <envoy_api_field_auth.CertificateValidationContext.verify_certificate_spki>`
  and :ref:`verify_certificate_hash <envoy_api_field_auth.CertificateValidationContext.verify_certificate_hash>`
  without :ref:`trusted_ca <envoy_api_field_auth.CertificateValidationContext.trusted_ca>`.
* tls: added support for allowing expired certificates with
  :ref:`allow_expired_certificate <envoy_api_field_auth.CertificateValidationContext.allow_expired_certificate>`.

  when acting as a client.
* tls: removed support for legacy SHA-2 CBC cipher suites.
* tracing: the sampling decision is now delegated to the tracers, allowing the tracer to decide when and if
  to use it. For example, if the :ref:`x-b3-sampled <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-b3-sampled>` header
  is supplied with the client request, its value will override any sampling decision made by the Envoy proxy.

  changes in this release. They are not listed here. Future releases will adhere to the policy and
  have clear documentation on deprecations and changes.
* Bazel is now the canonical build system (replacing CMake). There have been a huge number of
  changes to the development/build/test flow. See :repo:`/bazel/README.md` and

  limits at which point connection level back pressure is applied.
  Full end to end flow control will be available in a future release.

  The default cipher suites and ECDH curves have been updated with more modern defaults for both
  listener and cluster connections.
* The `header value match` rate limit action has been expanded to include an `expect
  match` parameter.
* Route level HTTP rate limit configurations now do not inherit the virtual host level
  configurations by default. Use `include_vh_rate_limits` to inherit the virtual host
  level options if desired.

  do not have `$maxTimeMS` set.
* The :ref:`MongoDB filter <config_network_filters_mongo_proxy>` now emits logs that are fully valid
  JSON.
