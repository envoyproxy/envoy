MongoDB
=======

Envoy supports a network level MongoDB sniffing filter with the following features:

* MongoDB wire format BSON parser.
* Detailed MongoDB query/operation statistics including timings and scatter/multi-get counts for
  routed clusters.
* Query logging.
* Per callsite statistics via the $comment query parameter.
* Fault injection.

The MongoDB filter is a good example of Envoyâ€™s extensibility and core abstractions, and can be used
to filter between all applications and MongoDB databases. It provides an invaluable source of data
that is agnostic to the application platform and specific MongoDB driver in use.
