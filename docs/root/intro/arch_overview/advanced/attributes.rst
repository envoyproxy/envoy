Attributes
==========

Attributes refer to contextual properties provided by Envoy during request and
connection processing. They are named by a dot-separated path (e.g.
``request.path``), have a fixed type (e.g. ``string`` or ``int``), and may be
absent or present depending on the context. Attributes are exposed to CEL
runtime in :ref:`RBAC filter <arch_overview_rbac>`, as well as Wasm extensions
via ``get_property`` ABI method.

Attribute value types are limited to:

* ``string`` for UTF-8 strings
* ``bytes`` for byte buffers
* ``int`` for 64-bit signed integers
* ``uint`` for 64-bit unsigned integers
* ``bool`` for booleans
* ``list`` for lists of values
* ``map`` for associative arrays with string keys
* ``timestamp`` for timestamps as specified by `Timestamp <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp>`_
* ``duration`` for durations as specified by `Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_
* Protocol buffer message types

CEL provides standard helper functions for operating on abstract types such as
``getMonth`` for ``timestamp`` values. Note that integer literals (e.g. ``7``) are of
type ``int``, which is distinct from ``uint`` (e.g. ``7u``), and the arithmetic
conversion is not automatic (use ``uint(7)`` for explicit conversion).

Wasm extensions receive the attribute values as a serialized buffer according
to the type of the attribute. Strings and bytes are passed as-is, integers are
passed as 64 bits directly, timestamps and durations are approximated to
nano-seconds, and structured values are converted to a sequence of pairs
recursively.

Request attributes
------------------

The following request attributes are generally available upon initial request
processing, which makes them suitable for RBAC policies.

``request.*`` attributes are only available in http filters.

.. csv-table::
   :header: Attribute, Type, Description
   :escape: '
   :widths: 1, 1, 4

   request.path, string, The path portion of the URL
   request.url_path, string, The path portion of the URL without the query string

Metadata and filter state
-------------------------

Data exchanged between filters is available as the following attributes:

.. csv-table::

   metadata, :ref:`Metadata<envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.metadata>`, Dynamic request metadata
   filter_state, "map<string, bytes>", Mapping from a filter state name to its serialized string value

Note that these attributes may change during the life of a request as the data can be
updated by filters at any point.

Wasm attributes

Path expressions
----------------

Path expressions allow access to inner fields in structured attributes via a
sequence of field names, map, and list indexes following an attribute name. For
example, ``get_property({"node", "id"})`` in Wasm ABI extracts the value of ``id``
field in ``node`` message attribute, while ``get_property({"request", "headers",
"my-header"})`` refers to the comma-concatenated value of a particular request
header.
