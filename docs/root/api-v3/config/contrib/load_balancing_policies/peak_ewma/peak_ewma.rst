Peak EWMA Load Balancer
========================

* This load balancer should be configured with the type URL ``type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.load_balancing_policies.peak_ewma.v3alpha.PeakEwma``.

.. note::

  Peak EWMA is a contrib extension that must be explicitly enabled at Envoy build time.
  See :ref:`install_contrib` for details.

The Peak EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) load balancer implements a latency-
and active-requests-aware variant of the Power of Two Choices (P2C) algorithm. It automatically
routes traffic to the best-performing hosts based on real-time latency measurements and
outstanding active requests.

Peak EWMA considers more input data than Envoy's other load balancing algorithms, which enables
it to make superior routing decisions. In the case of a slowdown, it seamlessly moves traffic
away from the affected host.

Peak EWMA is also well-suited for cross-data-center routing: it naturally prefers upstream
hosts in the closest data center, but seamlessly fails over to other data centers during
slowdowns (and fails back when performance recovers).

In scenarios where all upstream hosts have similar request latency, Peak EWMA behaves
equivalently to equal-weighted least request load balancing (using P2C selection).

.. note::

  Peak EWMA requires both the load balancing policy AND the HTTP filter to function properly.
  The HTTP filter (``envoy.filters.http.peak_ewma``) measures request RTT and provides timing
  data to the load balancer. Without the HTTP filter, the load balancer cannot collect
  latency measurements.

  Note: This requirement may change if Peak EWMA becomes a core Envoy load balancing algorithm
  in the future, which would require core changes to integrate RTT measurement functionality.

.. important::

  Peak EWMA considers latency and load when making routing decisions. It does **not** handle
  unhealthy hosts or error responses directly. This is especially critical because upstream hosts
  that fast-fail (return errors quickly) may appear to have low latency, causing Peak EWMA to send
  them a greater proportion of traffic â€” exactly the opposite of what you want.

  Always configure Envoy's :ref:`health checking <arch_overview_health_checking>` and
  :ref:`outlier detection <arch_overview_outlier_detection>` to automatically remove failing
  hosts from the load balancing pool before Peak EWMA makes routing decisions.

Algorithm Overview
------------------

Peak EWMA uses the cost function: ``Cost = RTT_peak_ewma * (active_requests + 1)``

Key characteristics:

* **Latency-sensitive**: Automatically de-prioritizes slow hosts
* **Load-aware**: Considers both latency and current request count
* **O(1) complexity**: Efficient P2C selection scales to large clusters
* **Adaptive**: No manual tuning required, responds to performance changes
* **Health-agnostic**: Operates only on healthy hosts as determined by health checking and outlier detection

Integration with Health Management
----------------------------------

Peak EWMA works in conjunction with Envoy's health management systems:

* **Health Checking**: Only hosts that pass active health checks are considered for load balancing
* **Outlier Detection**: Hosts ejected by outlier detection are automatically excluded from selection
* **Error Handling**: HTTP error responses (4xx/5xx) do not directly affect Peak EWMA routing decisions

For comprehensive host health management, configure Peak EWMA alongside:

.. code-block:: yaml

  cluster:
    # Health checking removes unresponsive hosts
    health_checks:
    - timeout: 5s
      interval: 10s
      http_health_check:
        path: "/health"

    # Outlier detection removes hosts with high error rates
    outlier_detection:
      consecutive_5xx: 3
      interval: 30s
      base_ejection_time: 30s

    # Peak EWMA optimizes among remaining healthy hosts

      - typed_extension_config:
          name: envoy.load_balancing_policies.peak_ewma
          typed_config:
            "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.load_balancing_policies.peak_ewma.v3alpha.PeakEwma
            decay_time: 10s

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Peak EWMA supports the following configuration parameters:

**decay_time** (``google.protobuf.Duration``, default: 10s)
  The time window over which latency observations decay to half their original weight.
  Shorter values adapt faster to performance changes, longer values provide more stability.

**aggregation_interval** (``google.protobuf.Duration``, default: 100ms)
  Frequency of EWMA data aggregation from worker threads. Lower values provide fresher
  data but increase CPU overhead.

**max_samples_per_host** (``google.protobuf.UInt32Value``, default: 1,000)
  Ring buffer size per host per worker thread for RTT samples. Larger values handle
  traffic bursts better but consume more memory.

  Buffer capacity = max_samples_per_host / aggregation_interval = RPS capacity per host per worker.

**default_rtt** (``google.protobuf.Duration``, default: 10ms)
  Baseline RTT for cost calculations when no measurements are available yet. Should
  reflect expected latency in your environment.

**penalty_value** (``google.protobuf.DoubleValue``, default: 1,000,000.0)
  Cost penalty for hosts without RTT data. You probably should not change this value.

Example configuration
