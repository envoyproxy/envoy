Access logging
==============

Configuration
-------------------------

Access logs are configured as part of the :ref:`HTTP connection manager config
<config_http_conn_man>` or :ref:`TCP Proxy <config_network_filters_tcp_proxy>`.

* :ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.accesslog.v3.AccessLog>`

.. _config_access_log_format:

Format Rules
------------

Access log formats contain command operators that extract the relevant data and insert it.
They support two formats: :ref:`"format strings" <config_access_log_format_strings>` and
:ref:`"format dictionaries" <config_access_log_format_dictionaries>`. In both cases, the command operators
are used to extract the relevant data, which is then inserted into the specified log format.
Only one access log format may be specified at a time.

.. _config_access_log_format_strings:

Format Strings
--------------

Format strings are plain strings, specified using the ``format`` key. They may contain
either command operators or other characters interpreted as a plain string.
The access log formatter does not make any assumptions about a new line separator, so one
has to specified as part of the format string.
See the :ref:`default format <config_access_log_default_format>` for an example.

.. _config_access_log_default_format:

Default Format String
---------------------

If custom format string is not specified, Envoy uses the following default format:

.. code-block:: none

  [%START_TIME%] "%REQ(:METHOD)% %REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)% %PROTOCOL%"
  %RESPONSE_CODE% %RESPONSE_FLAGS% %BYTES_RECEIVED% %BYTES_SENT% %DURATION%
  %RESP(X-ENVOY-UPSTREAM-SERVICE-TIME)% "%REQ(X-FORWARDED-FOR)%" "%REQ(USER-AGENT)%"
  "%REQ(X-REQUEST-ID)%" "%REQ(:AUTHORITY)%" "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"\n

Example of the default Envoy access log format:

.. code-block:: none

  [2016-04-15T20:17:00.310Z] "POST /api/v1/locations HTTP/2" 204 - 154 0 226 100 "10.0.35.28"
  "nsq2http" "cc21d9b0-cf5c-432b-8c7e-98aeb7988cd2" "locations" "tcp://10.0.2.1:80"

.. _config_access_log_format_dictionaries:

Format Dictionaries
-------------------

Format dictionaries are dictionaries that specify a structured access log output format,
specified using the ``json_format`` or ``typed_json_format`` keys. This allows logs to be output in
a structured format such as JSON. Similar to format strings, command operators are evaluated and
their values inserted into the format dictionary to construct the log output.

For example, with the following format provided in the configuration as ``json_format``:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "config": {
      "json_format": {
          "protocol": "%PROTOCOL%",
          "duration": "%DURATION%",
          "my_custom_header": "%REQ(MY_CUSTOM_HEADER)%"
      }
    }
  }

The following JSON object would be written to the log file:

.. code-block:: json

  {"protocol": "HTTP/1.1", "duration": "123", "my_custom_header": "value_of_MY_CUSTOM_HEADER"}

This allows you to specify a custom key for each command operator.

The ``typed_json_format`` differs from ``json_format`` in that values are rendered as JSON numbers,
booleans, and nested objects or lists where applicable. In the example, the request duration
would be rendered as the number ``123``.

Format dictionaries have the following restrictions:

* The dictionary must map strings to strings (specifically, strings to command operators). Nesting
  is supported.
* When using the ``typed_json_format`` command operators will only produce typed output if the
  command operator is the only string that appears in the dictionary value. For example,
  ``"%DURATION%"`` will log a numeric duration value, but ``"%DURATION%.0"`` will log a string
  value.

.. note::

  When using the ``typed_json_format``, integer values that exceed :math:`2^{53}` will be
  represented with reduced precision as they must be converted to floating point numbers.

.. _config_access_log_command_operators:

Command Operators
-----------------

Command operators are used to extract values that will be inserted into the access logs.
The same operators are used by different types of access logs (such as HTTP and TCP). Some
fields may have slightly different meanings, depending on what type of log it is. Differences
are noted.

Note that if a value is not set/empty, the logs will contain a ``-`` character or, for JSON logs,
the string ``"-"``. For typed JSON logs unset values are represented as ``null`` values and empty
strings are rendered as ``""``. :ref:`omit_empty_values
<envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.SubstitutionFormatString.omit_empty_values>` option could be used
to omit empty values entirely.

Unless otherwise noted, command operators produce string outputs for typed JSON logs.

The following command operators are supported:

.. _config_access_log_format_start_time:

%START_TIME%
  HTTP
    Request start time including milliseconds.

  TCP
    Downstream connection start time including milliseconds.

  START_TIME can be customized using a `format string <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/put_time>`_.
  In addition to that, START_TIME also accepts following specifiers:

  +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Specifier              | Explanation                                                 |
  +========================+=============================================================+
  | ``%s``                 | The number of seconds since the Epoch                       |
  +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
  | ``%f``, ``%[1-9]f``    | Fractional seconds digits, default is 9 digits (nanosecond) |
  |                        +-------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                        | - ``%3f`` millisecond (3 digits)                            |
  |                        | - ``%6f`` microsecond (6 digits)                            |
  |                        | - ``%9f`` nanosecond (9 digits)                             |
  +------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

  Examples of formatting START_TIME is as follows:

  .. code-block:: none

    %START_TIME(%Y/%m/%dT%H:%M:%S%z %s)%

    # To include millisecond fraction of the second (.000 ... .999). E.g. 1527590590.528.
    %START_TIME(%s.%3f)%

    %START_TIME(%s.%6f)%

    %START_TIME(%s.%9f)%

  In typed JSON logs, START_TIME is always rendered as a string.

%REQUEST_HEADERS_BYTES%
  HTTP
    Uncompressed bytes of request headers.

  TCP
    Not implemented (0).

%BYTES_RECEIVED%
  HTTP
    Body bytes received.

%PROTOCOL%

  In typed JSON logs, PROTOCOL will render the string ``"-"`` if the protocol is not
  available (e.g. in TCP logs).

%RESPONSE_CODE%
  HTTP
    HTTP response code. Note that a response code of '0' means that the server never sent the
    beginning of a response. This generally means that the (downstream) client disconnected.

    Note that in the case of 100-continue responses, only the response code of the final headers
    will be logged. If a 100-continue is followed by a 200, the logged response will be 200.
    If a 100-continue results in a disconnect, the 100 will be logged.

  TCP
    Not implemented ("-")

%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS%
  Remote address of the downstream connection. If the address is an IP address it includes both
  address and port.

    <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-for>`.

%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_PORT%

    and Z is an optional parameter denoting string truncation up to Z characters long. Dynamic Metadata
    can be set by filters using the :repo:`StreamInfo <envoy/stream_info/stream_info.h>` API:
    *setDynamicMetadata*. The data will be logged as a JSON string. For example, for the following dynamic metadata:

    ``com.test.my_filter: {"test_key": "foo", "test_object": {"inner_key": "bar"}}``

  .. note::

    For typed JSON logs, this operator renders a single value with string, numeric, or boolean type
    when the referenced key is a simple value. If the referenced key is a struct or list value, a
    JSON struct or list is rendered. Structs and lists may be nested. In any event, the maximum

    Z is an optional parameter denoting string truncation up to Z characters long.
    F is an optional parameter used to indicate which method FilterState uses for serialization.
    If 'PLAIN' is set, the filter state object will be serialized as an unstructured string.
    If 'TYPED' is set or no F provided, the filter state object will be serialized as an JSON string.

  TCP
    Same as HTTP, the filter state is from connection instead of a L7 request.
