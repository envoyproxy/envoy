ZooKeeper proxy
===============

The ZooKeeper proxy filter decodes the client protocol for
`Apache ZooKeeper <https://zookeeper.apache.org/>`_. It decodes the requests,
responses and events in the payload. Most opcodes known in
`ZooKeeper 3.5 <https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/ZooDefs.java>`_
are supported. The unsupported ones are related to SASL authentication.

.. attention::

   The zookeeper_proxy filter is experimental and is currently under active
   development. Capabilities will be expanded over time and the
   configuration structures are likely to change.

.. _config_network_filters_zookeeper_proxy_config:

Configuration
-------------

The ZooKeeper proxy filter should be chained with the TCP proxy filter as shown
in the configuration snippet below:

.. code-block:: yaml

  filter_chains:
  - filters:
    - name: envoy.filters.network.zookeeper_proxy
      config:
        stat_prefix: zookeeper
    - name: envoy.tcp_proxy
      config:
        stat_prefix: tcp
        cluster: ...


.. _config_network_filters_zookeeper_proxy_stats:

Statistics
----------

Every configured ZooKeeper proxy filter has statistics rooted at *zookeeper.<stat_prefix>.* with the
following statistics:

Dynamic Metadata
----------------

The ZooKeeper filter emits the following dynamic metadata for each message parsed:
