Response Code Details
=====================

If _%RESPONSE_CODE_DETAILS%_ is configured on via :ref:`access logging<config_access_log_format_response_code_details>`,
or :ref:`custom headers<config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers>` Envoy will communicate the detailed
reason a given stream ended.
This page lists the details sent by the HttpConnectionManager, Router filter, and codecs. It is not comprehensive as
any other filters may send their own local replies with custom details.

Below are the list of reasons the HttpConnectionManager or Router filter may send responses or reset streams.

.. warning::
  The following list is not guaranteed to be stable, since the details are subject to change.

   :header: Name, Description
   :widths: 1, 2

   absolute_path_rejected, The request was rejected due to using an absolute path on a route not supporting them.

   direct_response, A direct response was generated by the router filter.
   filter_chain_not_found, The request was rejected due to no matching filter chain.
   filter_removed_required_request_headers, The request was rejected in the filter manager because a configured filter removed required request headers.
   filter_removed_required_response_headers, The response was rejected in the filter manager because a configured filter removed required response headers or these values were invalid (e.g. overflown status).
   internal_redirect, The original stream was replaced with an internal redirect.
   low_version, The HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/0.9 request was rejected due to HTTP/1.0 support not being configured.

   original_ip_detection_failed, The request was rejected because the original IP couldn't be detected.
   path_normalization_failed, "The request was rejected because path normalization was configured on and failed, probably due to an invalid path."
   request_headers_failed_strict_check, The request was rejected due to x-envoy-* headers failing strict header validation.
   request_overall_timeout, The per-stream total request timeout was exceeded.
   request_payload_exceeded_retry_buffer_limit, Envoy is doing streaming proxying but too much data arrived while waiting to attempt a retry.
   request_payload_too_large, Envoy is doing non-streaming proxying and the request payload exceeded configured limits.
   response_payload_too_large, Envoy is doing non-streaming proxying and the response payload exceeded configured limits.
   route_configuration_not_found, The request was rejected because there was no route configuration found.
   route_not_found, The request was rejected because there was no route found.
   stream_idle_timeout, The per-stream keepalive timeout was exceeded.
   upgrade_failed, The request was rejected because it attempted an unsupported upgrade.
   upstream_max_stream_duration_reached, The request was destroyed because of it exceeded the configured max stream duration.
   upstream_per_try_timeout, The final upstream try timed out.
   upstream_reset_after_response_started{details}, The upstream connection was reset after a response was started. This may include further details about the cause of the disconnect.
   upstream_reset_before_response_started{details}, The upstream connection was reset before a response was started This may include further details about the cause of the disconnect.
