Dynamic forward proxy
=====================

* HTTP dynamic forward proxy :ref:`architecture overview <arch_overview_http_dynamic_forward_proxy>`
* :ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.FilterConfig>`
* This filter should be configured with the name *envoy.filters.http.dynamic_forward_proxy*

The following is a complete configuration that configures both the
:ref:`dynamic forward proxy HTTP filter
<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.FilterConfig>`
as well as the :ref:`dynamic forward proxy cluster
<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.clusters.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.ClusterConfig>`. Both filter and cluster
must be configured together and point to the same DNS cache parameters for Envoy to operate as an
HTTP dynamic forward proxy.

This filter supports :ref:`host rewrite <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.FilterConfig>`
via the :ref:`virtual host's typed_per_filter_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.typed_per_filter_config>` or the
:ref:`route's typed_per_filter_config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.Route.typed_per_filter_config>`. This can be used to rewrite
the host header with the provided value before DNS lookup, thus allowing to route traffic to the rewritten
host when forwarding. See the example below within the configured routes.

.. note::

  Configuring a :ref:`transport_socket with name envoy.transport_sockets.tls <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.transport_socket>` on the cluster with
  *trusted_ca* certificates instructs Envoy to use TLS when connecting to upstream hosts and verify
  the certificate chain. Additionally, Envoy will automatically perform SAN verification for the
  resolved host name as well as specify the host name via SNI.

.. _dns_cache_circuit_breakers:

  Dynamic forward proxy uses circuit breakers built in to the DNS cache with the configuration
  of :ref:`DNS cache circuit breakers <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_cache_circuit_breaker>`.
