.. _config_http_filters_fault_injection:

Fault Injection
===============

The fault injection filter can be used to test the resiliency of
microservices to different forms of failures. The filter can be used to
inject delays and abort requests with user-specified error codes, thereby
providing the ability to stage different failure scenarios such as service
failures, service overloads, high network latency, network partitions,
etc. Faults injection can be limited to a specific set of requests based on
the (destination) upstream cluster of a request and/or a set of pre-defined
request headers.

The scope of failures is restricted to those that are observable by an
application communicating over the network. CPU and disk failures on the
local host cannot be emulated.

Configuration
-------------

.. note::

  The fault injection filter must be inserted before any other filter,
  including the router filter.

* This filter should be configured with the type URL ``type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault``.
* :ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault>`

.. _config_http_filters_fault_injection_http_header:

Controlling fault injection via HTTP headers
--------------------------------------------

The fault filter has the capability to allow fault configuration to be specified by the caller.
This is useful in certain scenarios in which it is desired to allow the client to specify its own
fault configuration. The currently supported header controls are:

x-envoy-fault-abort-request
  HTTP status code to abort a request with. The header value should be an integer that specifies
  the HTTP status code to return in response to a request and must be in the range [200, 600).
  In order for the header to work, :ref:`header_abort
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.FaultAbort.header_abort>` needs to be set.

x-envoy-fault-abort-grpc-request
  gRPC status code to abort a request with. The header value should be a non-negative integer that specifies
  the gRPC status code to return in response to a request. Its value range is [0, UInt32.Max] instead of [0, 16]
  to allow testing even not well-defined gRPC status codes. When this header is set, the HTTP response status code
  will be set to 200. In order for the header to work, :ref:`header_abort
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.FaultAbort.header_abort>` needs to be set. If both
  *x-envoy-fault-abort-request* and *x-envoy-fault-abort-grpc-request* headers are set then
  *x-envoy-fault-abort-grpc-request* header will be **ignored** and fault response http status code will be
  set to *x-envoy-fault-abort-request* header value.

x-envoy-fault-abort-request-percentage
  The percentage of requests that should be failed with a status code that's defined
  by the value of *x-envoy-fault-abort-request* or *x-envoy-fault-abort-grpc-request* HTTP headers.
  The header value should be an integer that specifies the numerator of the percentage of request to apply aborts
  to and must be greater or equal to 0 and its maximum value is capped by the value of the numerator of
  :ref:`percentage <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.FaultAbort.percentage>` field.
  Percentage's denominator is equal to default percentage's denominator
  :ref:`percentage <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.FaultAbort.percentage>` field.
  In order for the header to work, :ref:`header_abort
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.FaultAbort.header_abort>` needs to be set and
  either *x-envoy-fault-abort-request* or *x-envoy-fault-abort-grpc-request* HTTP header needs to be a part of the request.

x-envoy-fault-delay-request
  The duration to delay a request by. The header value should be an integer that specifies the number
  of milliseconds to throttle the latency for. In order for the header to work, :ref:`header_delay
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultDelay.header_delay>` needs to be set.

x-envoy-fault-delay-request-percentage
  The percentage of requests that should be delayed by a duration that's defined by the value of
  *x-envoy-fault-delay-request* HTTP header. The header value should be an integer that
  specifies the percentage of request to apply delays to and must be greater
  or equal to 0 and its maximum value is capped by the value of the numerator of
  :ref:`percentage <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultDelay.percentage>` field.
  Percentage's denominator is equal to default percentage's denominator
  :ref:`percentage <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultDelay.percentage>` field.
  In order for the header to work, :ref:`header_delay
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultDelay.header_delay>` needs to be set and
  *x-envoy-fault-delay-request* HTTP header needs to be a part of a request.

x-envoy-fault-throughput-response
  The rate limit to use when a response to a caller is sent. The header value should be an integer
  that specifies the limit in KiB/s and must be > 0. In order for the header to work, :ref:`header_limit
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultRateLimit.header_limit>` needs to be set.

x-envoy-fault-throughput-response-percentage
  The percentage of requests whose response rate should be limited to the value of
  *x-envoy-fault-throughput-response* HTTP header. The header value should be an integer that
  specifies the percentage of request to apply delays to and must be greater
  or equal to 0 and its maximum value is capped by the value of the numerator of
  :ref:`percentage <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultRateLimit.percentage>` field.
  Percentage's denominator is equal to default percentage's denominator
  :ref:`percentage <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultRateLimit.percentage>` field.
  In order for the header to work, :ref:`header_limit
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultRateLimit.header_limit>` needs to be set and
  *x-envoy-fault-delay-request* HTTP header needs to be a part of a request.

.. attention::

  Allowing header control is inherently dangerous if exposed to untrusted clients. In this case,
  it is suggested to use the :ref:`max_active_faults
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault.max_active_faults>` setting to limit the
  maximum concurrent faults that can be active at any given time.

.. note::

  If the headers appear multiple times only the first value is used.

The following is an example configuration that enables header control for both of the above
options:

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: envoy.filters.http.fault
  typed_config:
    "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault
    max_active_faults: 100
    abort:
      header_abort: {}
      percentage:
        numerator: 100
    delay:
      header_delay: {}
      percentage:
        numerator: 100
    response_rate_limit:
      header_limit: {}
      percentage:
        numerator: 100

.. _config_http_filters_fault_injection_runtime:

Runtime
-------

The HTTP fault injection filter supports the following global runtime settings:

.. attention::

  Some of the following runtime keys require the filter to be configured for the specific fault
  type and some do not. Please consult the documentation for each key for more information.

fault.http.abort.abort_percent
  % of requests that will be aborted if the headers match. Defaults to the
  *abort_percent* specified in config. If the config does not contain an
  *abort* block, then *abort_percent* defaults to 0. For historic reasons, this runtime key is
  available regardless of whether the filter is :ref:`configured for abort
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault.abort>`.

fault.http.abort.http_status
  HTTP status code that will be used as the response status code of requests that will be
  aborted if the headers match. Defaults to the HTTP status code specified
  in the config. If the config does not contain an *abort* block, then
  *http_status* defaults to 0. For historic reasons, this runtime key is
  available regardless of whether the filter is :ref:`configured for abort
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault.abort>`.

fault.http.abort.grpc_status
  gRPC status code that will be used as the response status code of requests that will be
  aborted if the headers match. Defaults to the gRPC status code specified in the config.
  If this field is missing from both the runtime and the config, gRPC status code in the response
  will be derived from *fault.http.abort.http_status* field. This runtime key is only available when
  the filter is :ref:`configured for abort <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault.abort>`.

fault.http.delay.fixed_delay_percent
  % of requests that will be delayed if the headers match. Defaults to the
  *delay_percent* specified in the config or 0 otherwise. This runtime key is only available when
  the filter is :ref:`configured for delay
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault.delay>`.

fault.http.delay.fixed_duration_ms
  The delay duration in milliseconds. If not specified, the
  *fixed_duration_ms* specified in the config will be used. If this field
  is missing from both the runtime and the config, no delays will be
  injected. This runtime key is only available when the filter is :ref:`configured for delay
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault.delay>`.

fault.http.max_active_faults
  The maximum number of active faults (of all types) that Envoy will will inject via the fault
  filter. This can be used in cases where it is desired that faults are 100% injected,
  but the user wants to avoid a situation in which too many unexpected concurrent faulting requests
  cause resource constraint issues. If not specified, the :ref:`max_active_faults
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault.max_active_faults>` setting will be used.

fault.http.rate_limit.response_percent
  % of requests which will have a response rate limit fault injected. Defaults to the value set in
  the :ref:`percentage <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.common.fault.v3.FaultRateLimit.percentage>` field.
  This runtime key is only available when the filter is :ref:`configured for response rate limiting
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.fault.v3.HTTPFault.response_rate_limit>`.

*Note*, fault filter runtime settings for the specific downstream cluster
override the default ones if present. The following are downstream specific
runtime keys:

* fault.http.<downstream-cluster>.abort.abort_percent
* fault.http.<downstream-cluster>.abort.http_status
* fault.http.<downstream-cluster>.delay.fixed_delay_percent
* fault.http.<downstream-cluster>.delay.fixed_duration_ms

Downstream cluster name is taken from
:ref:`the HTTP x-envoy-downstream-service-cluster <config_http_conn_man_headers_downstream-service-cluster>`
header. If the following settings are not found in the runtime it defaults to the global runtime settings
which defaults to the config settings.

.. _config_http_filters_fault_injection_stats:

Statistics
----------

The fault filter outputs statistics in the ``http.<stat_prefix>.fault.`` namespace. The :ref:`stat prefix
<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.stat_prefix>` comes from the
owning HTTP connection manager.
