gRPC HTTP/1.1 bridge
====================

* gRPC :ref:`architecture overview <arch_overview_grpc>`
* :ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpFilter.name>`
* This filter should be configured with the name *envoy.filters.http.grpc_http1_bridge*.

This is a simple filter which enables the bridging of an HTTP/1.1 client which does not support
response trailers to a compliant gRPC server. It works by doing the following:

* When a request is sent, the filter sees if the connection is HTTP/1.1 and the request content type
  is *application/grpc*.
* If so, when the response is received, the filter buffers it and waits for trailers and then checks the
  *grpc-status* code. If it is not zero, the filter switches the HTTP response code to 503. It also copies
  the *grpc-status* and *grpc-message* trailers into the response headers so that the client can look
  at them if it wishes.
* The client should send HTTP/1.1 requests that translate to the following pseudo headers:

  * *\:method*: POST
  * *\:path*: <gRPC-METHOD-NAME>
  * *content-type*: application/grpc

* The body should be the serialized grpc body which is:

  * 1 byte of zero (not compressed).
  * network order 4 bytes of proto message length.
  * serialized proto message.

* Because this scheme must buffer the response to look for the *grpc-status* trailer it will only
  work with unary gRPC APIs.

This filter also collects stats for all gRPC requests that transit, even if those requests are
normal gRPC requests over HTTP/2 or above.

More info: wire format in `gRPC over HTTP/2 <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md>`_.

.. attention::

   Note that statistics should be collected by the dedicated :ref:`gRPC stats filter
   <config_http_filters_grpc_stats>` instead. The use of this filter for gRPC telemetry
   has been disabled. Set the runtime value of ``envoy.reloadable_features.grpc_bridge_stats_disabled``
   to false to turn on stat collection.

Statistics
----------

The filter emits statistics in the *cluster.<route target cluster>.grpc.* namespace.
