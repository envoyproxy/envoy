gRPC-JSON transcoder
====================

* gRPC :ref:`architecture overview <arch_overview_grpc>`
* :ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.grpc_json_transcoder.v3.GrpcJsonTranscoder>`
* This filter should be configured with the name *envoy.filters.http.grpc_json_transcoder*.

This is a filter which allows a RESTful JSON API client to send requests to Envoy over HTTP
and get proxied to a gRPC service. The HTTP mapping for the gRPC service has to be defined by
`custom options <https://cloud.google.com/service-management/reference/rpc/google.api#http>`_.

JSON mapping
------------

The protobuf to JSON mapping is defined `here <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json>`_. For
gRPC stream request parameters, Envoy expects an array of messages, and it returns an array of messages for stream
response parameters.

.. _config_grpc_json_generate_proto_descriptor_set:

How to generate proto descriptor set
------------------------------------

Envoy has to know the proto descriptor of your gRPC service in order to do the transcoding.

To generate a protobuf descriptor set for the gRPC service, you'll also need to clone the
googleapis repository from GitHub before running protoc, as you'll need annotations.proto
in your include path, to define the HTTP mapping.

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis
  $ GOOGLEAPIS_DIR=<your-local-googleapis-folder>

Then run protoc to generate the descriptor set. For example using the test
:repo:`bookstore.proto <test/proto/bookstore.proto>` provided in the Envoy repository:

.. code-block:: console

  $ protoc -I$(GOOGLEAPIS_DIR) -I. --include_imports --include_source_info \
      --descriptor_set_out=proto.pb test/proto/bookstore.proto

If you have more than one proto source files, you can pass all of them in one command.

Route configs for transcoded requests
-------------------------------------

The route configs to be used with the gRPC-JSON transcoder should be identical to the gRPC route.
The requests processed by the transcoder filter will have ``/<package>.<service>/<method>`` path and
``POST`` method. The route configs for those requests should match on ``/<package>.<service>/<method>``,
not the incoming request path. This allows the routes to be used for both gRPC requests and
gRPC-JSON transcoded requests.

For example, with the following proto example, the router will process ``/helloworld.Greeter/SayHello``
as the path, so the route config prefix ``/say`` won't match requests to ``SayHello``. If you want to
match the incoming request path, set ``match_incoming_request_route`` to true.

.. literalinclude:: _include/helloworld.proto
    :language: proto

Assuming you have checked out the google APIs as described above, and have saved the proto file as
``protos/helloworld.proto`` you can build it with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ protoc -I$(GOOGLEAPIS_DIR) -I. --include_imports --include_source_info \
      --descriptor_set_out=protos/helloworld.pb protos/helloworld.proto


Sending arbitrary content
-------------------------

By default, when transcoding occurs, gRPC-JSON encodes the message output of a gRPC service method into
JSON and sets the HTTP response ``Content-Type`` header to ``application/json``. To send arbitrary content,
a gRPC service method can use
`google.api.HttpBody <https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto>`_
as its output message type. The implementation needs to set
`content_type <https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto#L68>`_
(which sets the value of the HTTP response ``Content-Type`` header) and
`data <https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto#L71>`_
(which sets the HTTP response body) accordingly.
Multiple `google.api.HttpBody <https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto>`_
can be send by the gRPC server in the server streaming case.
In this case, HTTP response header ``Content-Type`` will use the ``content-type`` from the first
`google.api.HttpBody <https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto>`_.

Headers
--------

gRPC-JSON forwards the following headers to the gRPC server:

* ``x-envoy-original-path``, containing the value of the original path of HTTP request
* ``x-envoy-original-method``, containing the value of the original method of HTTP request


Sample Envoy configuration
--------------------------

Here's a sample Envoy configuration that proxies to a gRPC server running on localhost:50051. Port 51051 proxies
gRPC requests and uses the gRPC-JSON transcoder filter to provide the RESTful JSON mapping. I.e., you can make either
gRPC or RESTful JSON requests to localhost:51051.
