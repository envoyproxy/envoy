.. _config_http_filters_cors:

CORS
====

This is a filter which handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing requests based on route or virtual host settings.
For the meaning of the headers please refer to the pages below.

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
* https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
* This filter should be configured with the type URL ``type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.cors.v3.Cors``.
* :ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.cors.v3.CorsPolicy>`


.. note::
  This filter will be used to respond to preflight ``OPTIONS`` requests. Any legal ``OPTIONS`` requests will be
  responded directly by the filter and will not be passed to the next filter in the filter chain. Other requests
  will not be responded directly but if they are accepted cors requests, matching configured allowed origins,
  the filter will add the related headers to the response.

  In addition, this filter will be bypassed if a direct response or route redirect is configured for the route.


.. _cors-runtime:

Runtime
-------
The fraction of requests for which the filter is enabled can be configured via the :ref:`runtime_key
<envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.RuntimeFractionalPercent.runtime_key>` value of the :ref:`filter_enabled
<envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.CorsPolicy.filter_enabled>` field.

The fraction of requests for which the filter is enabled in shadow-only mode can be configured via
the :ref:`runtime_key <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.RuntimeFractionalPercent.runtime_key>` value of the
:ref:`shadow_enabled <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.CorsPolicy.shadow_enabled>` field. When enabled in
shadow-only mode, the filter will evaluate the request's *Origin* to determine if it's valid but
will not enforce any policies.

.. note::

  If both ``filter_enabled`` and ``shadow_enabled`` are on, the ``filter_enabled``
  flag will take precedence.

.. _cors-statistics:

Statistics
----------

The CORS filter outputs statistics in the ``<stat_prefix>.cors.*`` namespace.

.. note::
  Requests that do not have an Origin header will be omitted from statistics.

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Type, Description
  :widths: 1, 1, 2

  origin_valid, Counter, Number of requests that have a valid Origin header.
  origin_invalid, Counter, Number of requests that have an invalid Origin header.
