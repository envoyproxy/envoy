HTTP Inspector
==============

HTTP Inspector listener filter allows detecting whether the application protocol appears to be HTTP,
and if it is HTTP, it detects the HTTP protocol (HTTP/1.x or HTTP/2) further. This can be used to select a
:ref:`FilterChain <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.listener.v3.FilterChain>` via the :ref:`application_protocols <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.FilterChainMatch.application_protocols>`
of a :ref:`FilterChainMatch <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.listener.v3.FilterChainMatch>`.

* :ref:`Listener filter v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.listener.http_inspector.v3.HttpInspector>`
* This filter should be configured with the name *envoy.filters.listener.http_inspector*.

Example
-------

A sample filter configuration could be:
