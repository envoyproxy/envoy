ZooKeeper proxy
===============

The ZooKeeper proxy filter decodes the client protocol for
`Apache ZooKeeper <https://zookeeper.apache.org/>`_. It decodes the requests,
responses and events in the payload. Most opcodes known in
`ZooKeeper 3.5 <https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/zookeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zookeeper/ZooDefs.java>`_
are supported. The unsupported ones are related to SASL authentication.

:ref:`v3 API reference <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.zookeeper_proxy.v3.ZooKeeperProxy>`

.. attention::

   The zookeeper_proxy filter is experimental and is currently under active
   development. Capabilities will be expanded over time and the
   configuration structures are likely to change.

.. _config_network_filters_zookeeper_proxy_config:

Configuration
-------------

The ZooKeeper proxy filter should be chained with the TCP proxy filter as shown
in the configuration snippet below:

.. literalinclude:: _include/zookeeper-filter-proxy.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :caption: :download:`zookeeper-filter-proxy.yaml <_include/zookeeper-filter-proxy.yaml>`

.. _config_network_filters_zookeeper_proxy_stats:

Statistics
----------

Every configured ZooKeeper proxy filter has statistics rooted at *<stat_prefix>.zookeeper.*.

``_resp_fast`` and ``_resp_slow`` are per-opcode metrics and will only be emitted when :ref:`enable_latency_threshold_metrics <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.zookeeper_proxy.v3.ZooKeeperProxy.enable_latency_threshold_metrics>` is set to ``true``.

``_rq_bytes`` are per-opcode metrics and will only be emitted when :ref:`enable_per_opcode_request_bytes_metrics <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.zookeeper_proxy.v3.ZooKeeperProxy.enable_per_opcode_request_bytes_metrics>` is set to ``true``.

``_resp_bytes`` are per-opcode metrics and will only be emitted when :ref:`enable_per_opcode_response_bytes_metrics <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.zookeeper_proxy.v3.ZooKeeperProxy.enable_per_opcode_response_bytes_metrics>` is set to ``true``.

``_decoder_error`` are per-opcode metrics and will only be emitted when :ref:`enable_per_opcode_decoder_error_metrics <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.zookeeper_proxy.v3.ZooKeeperProxy.enable_per_opcode_decoder_error_metrics>` is set to ``true``.
