Per user agent statistics
-------------------------

Additional per user agent statistics are rooted at *http.<stat_prefix>.user_agent.<user_agent>.*
Currently Envoy matches user agent for both iOS (*ios*) and Android (*android*) and produces
the following statistics:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Type, Description
   :widths: 1, 1, 2

   downstream_cx_total, Counter, Total connections
   downstream_cx_destroy_remote_active_rq, Counter, Total connections destroyed remotely with 1+ active requests
   downstream_rq_total, Counter, Total requests

.. _config_http_conn_man_stats_per_listener:

Per listener statistics
-----------------------

Additional per listener statistics are rooted at *listener.<address>.http.<stat_prefix>.* with the
following statistics:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Type, Description
   :widths: 1, 1, 2

   downstream_rq_completed, Counter, Total responses
   downstream_rq_1xx, Counter, Total 1xx responses
   downstream_rq_2xx, Counter, Total 2xx responses
   downstream_rq_3xx, Counter, Total 3xx responses
   downstream_rq_4xx, Counter, Total 4xx responses
   downstream_rq_5xx, Counter, Total 5xx responses

.. _config_http_conn_man_stats_per_codec:

Per codec statistics
-----------------------

Each codec has the option of adding per-codec statistics. Both http1 and http2 have codec stats.

Http1 codec statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All http1 statistics are rooted at *http1.*

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Type, Description
   :widths: 1, 1, 2

   metadata_not_supported_error, Counter, Total number of metadata dropped during HTTP/1 encoding

Http2 codec statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All http2 statistics are rooted at *http2.*

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Type, Description
   :widths: 1, 1, 2

   header_overflow, Counter, Total number of connections reset due to the headers being larger than the :ref:`configured value <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.max_request_headers_kb>`.
   headers_cb_no_stream, Counter, Total number of errors where a header callback is called without an associated stream. This tracks an unexpected occurrence due to an as yet undiagnosed bug
   rx_messaging_error, Counter, Total number of invalid received frames that violated `section 8 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8>`_ of the HTTP/2 spec. This will result in a *tx_reset*
   rx_reset, Counter, Total number of reset stream frames received by Envoy
   too_many_header_frames, Counter, Total number of times an HTTP2 connection is reset due to receiving too many headers frames. Envoy currently supports proxying at most one header frame for 100-Continue one non-100 response code header frame and one frame with trailers
   trailers, Counter, Total number of trailers seen on requests coming from downstream
   tx_reset, Counter, Total number of reset stream frames transmitted by Envoy

Tracing statistics
------------------

Tracing statistics are emitted when tracing decisions are made. All tracing statistics are rooted at *http.<stat_prefix>.tracing.* with the following statistics:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Type, Description
   :widths: 1, 1, 2

   random_sampling, Counter, Total number of traceable decisions by random sampling
   service_forced, Counter, Total number of traceable decisions by server runtime flag *tracing.global_enabled*
   client_enabled, Counter, Total number of traceable decisions by request header *x-envoy-force-trace*
   not_traceable, Counter, Total number of non-traceable decisions by request id
   health_check, Counter, Total number of non-traceable decisions by health check
