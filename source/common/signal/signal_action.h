/**
 * This class installs signal handlers for fatal signal types.
 *
 * These signals are handled:
 *   SIGABRT
 *   SIGBUS
 *   SIGFPE
 *   SIGILL
 *   SIGSEGV
 *
 * Upon intercepting the signal the following actions are taken:
 *
 *   A Backtrace is printed from the address the signal was encountered at, if
 *   it is possible to retrieve.
 *
 *   The signal handler is reset to the default handler (which is expected to
 *   terminate the process).
 *
 *   The signal is raised again (which ultimately kills the process)
 *
 * The signal handler must run on an alternative stack so that we can do the
 * stack unwind on the original stack. Memory is allocated for this purpose when
 * this object is constructed. When this object goes out of scope the memory
 * used for the alternate signal stack is destroyed and the previous signal handler
 * and alt stack if previously used are restored.
 *
 * Note that we do NOT restore the previously saved sigaction and alt stack in
 * the signal handler itself. This is fraught with complexity and has little
 * benefit. The inner most scope SignalAction will terminate the process by
 * re-raising the fatal signal with default handler.
 *
 * It is recommended that this object be instantiated at the highest possible
 * scope, e.g., in main(). This enables fatal signal handling for almost all code
 * executed. Because of the save-and-restore behavior it is possible for
 * SignalAction to be used at both wider and tighter scopes without issue.
