// Manages a block of raw memory for objects of type T. T is generally expected
// to be a POD, where it makes sense to memcpy over it. This class carries extra
// member variables for tracking size, and a write-pointer to support safe
// appends.
//
// MemBlockBuilder is used to safely write blocks of data into a memory
// buffer. Due to two extra member variables, it is not optimal for storing in
// data structures. The intended usage model is to release the raw assembled
// memory block from the MemBlockBuilder for efficient storage.
//
// The goal for this class is to provide a usage model to replace direct usage
// of memcpy with a pattern that is easy to validate for correctness by
// inspection, asserts, and fuzzing, but when compiled for optimization is
// roughly as efficient as raw memcpy.
