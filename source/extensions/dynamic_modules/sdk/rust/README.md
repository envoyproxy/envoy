# Envoy Dynamic Modules Rust SDK

This directory contains the Rust SDK for the Dynamic Modules feature. The SDK passes the same set of tests and is guaranteed to provide the same functionality as the other SDKs. This directory is organized in the way that it can be used as a standalone Rust crate. The SDK is basically the high-level abstraction layer for the Dynamic Modules ABI defined in the [abi.h](../../abi.h).

Currently, the ABI binding ([src/abi.rs](./src/abi.rs)) is manually generated by [`bindgen`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) for the ABI header. Ideally, we should be able to do the bindgen in the build.rs file. 

TODO(@mathetake): figure out how to properly setup the bindgen in build.rs with rules_rust. The most recommended way is to use [crate_universe](https://bazelbuild.github.io/rules_rust/crate_universe.html#setup) and use bindgen as a dev-dependency. However, it seems that crate_universe tries to use the underlying gcc system linker which we cannot assume always available.
