# Envoy Dynamic Modules Rust SDK

This directory contains the Rust SDK for the Dynamic Modules feature. This directory is organized in the way that it can be used as a standalone Rust crate. The SDK is basically the high-level abstraction layer for the Dynamic Modules ABI defined in the [abi.h](./abi.h). 
This directory is organized in the way that it can be used as a standalone Rust crate, hence the ABI header file is a hard-copy of the original ABI header files, not symlinks.
